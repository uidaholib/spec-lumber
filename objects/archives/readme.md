This folder is where you should put the archival version of the file you want to process. 

Once in here, you can then type `rake generate_derivatives` via the command line to make the official file, the small version, and the thumb version. 

You should then be able to drag the official file (e.g. '/objects/mg_example.jpg'), the achives directory (/objects/archives/), the small directory (/objects/small/),  and the thumbs directory (/objects/thumbs/) directly into the webpages objects directory. All the files will then be available.
