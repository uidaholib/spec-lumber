## About the Harvester

The Idaho Harvester features the most interesting and unique materials from the University of Idaho Library's [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/). 

We write about the images, stories, and historical narratives that catch our attention. Some posts are lengthier, dealing with complex subjects regarding Idaho history, industry, and the university, while others are shorter celebrations of notable days, people, and events. 

We are excited to share the fascinating content we come across during our daily work and to share our institutional knowledge in context with the library's [digital collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and with the [working collection](/collection/browse.html) contained herein.
