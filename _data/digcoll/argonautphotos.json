Until her retirement in 2006, she was the job locator and counselor for Student Financial Aid Services at the university. Previously, Thomas provided public relations and fundraising services for the Moscow-Pullman Pregnancy Counseling Service and was a social worker for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.

A graduate of Ohio State University, Thomas ran twice for the District 5 Idaho House seat. She was active in the National Organization for Women and served as NOW floor organizer at the National Democratic Convention in Los Angeles. She served as president of Idaho NOW and was on the NOW National Board of Directors. Former Gov. Cecil Andrus appointed Thomas to the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Task Force and the Idaho Council on Domestic Violence. She was the recipient of the Virginia Wolf Distinguished Service Award by the UI Women's Center, the Rosa Parks Award from the Latah County Human Rights Task Force, and the Athena Woman of the Year Award.
