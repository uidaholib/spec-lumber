For thirty-five years our campus has been home for the man who has earned the world over the very appropriate but non-professional title of Mr. Flotation. For twenty-one of those years Arthur W. Fahrenwald has been dean of our College of Mines and director of the Idaho State Bureau of Mines and Geology. New processes and new machines growing out of his research here are now in use in every mining district throughout the world. It is safe to say that 75 percent of all the ore treated by flotation goes through processes and machinery having their origin in his research at Idaho. The world over, flotation and Fahrenwald have became synonymous. many times he has been called to mining districts abroad to help on some special metallurgical problem. Through his contribution to more efficient and economical mineral recovery, millions of dollars have been added to the income of Idaho's mining industry throughout the world. \"To you, Dean Fahrenwald, by authority of the Regents, it is a pleasure and an honor to present with hearty congratulations and best wishes this certificate of merit and appointment emeritus effective upon your retirement from your deanship, 1 September 1954.\" J. E. Buchanan, President.",

Construction of the machine is a farm shop class project under the direction of L.M. Messersmith, farm shop instructor. Bean harvest at the Twin Falls branch station, center of the university's bean research, involves 3,000 to 4,000 separate threshing operations. A run may be anywhere from a pound of seed from a single short row to 500 pounds or more from a larger planting. Breeding stock plots, increase plantings, and small lots of seed from plant introductions from all parts of the world will go through the small thresher. Breeding and testing of bean varieties at the Twin Falls branch station is done in cooperation with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Designers of the small bean thresher to fill the special needs at the Twin Falls branch station where Marshall LeBaron, station superintendent, and Dr. Leslie Dean, associate plant pathologist stationed there. For threshing the beans from the research and testing plots they wanted a small machine that doesn't crack the beans and is self-cleaning between lots, so there will be no mixing. The machine will be ready to handle the 1954 harvest, Messersmith reports.",

        "description": "University Press Service:  University of Idaho, Moscow, Nov. [95] The \"migratory\" department of home economics at the University of Idaho has finally settled in its new four-story Collegiate-Gothic quarters after roaming from one building to another around the campus for half a century. An open-house in the new building this week will celebrate the new building and the 50th anniversary of home economics at the University of Idaho. The open-house is scheduled for Thursday, November 20, from 4 P.M. to 7 P.M. For years, the home economics department, or domestic science department, as it was often called, was broken into several parts with each section in different building. A cooking laboratory was the first section, located in Ridenbaugh hall in 1902, where the kitchen also served women students living in the dormitory. \"The principal difference between cooking laboratories early in the century and the present, aside from new equipment, is the method of teaching,\"  according to Professor Margaret Ritchie, head of the department. \"The family-centered teaching plan is used now, with three to four students working in a regular home kitchen unit rather than having small, inadequate facilities for each student.\" The home economics department finally was put under one roof in a wing of the Administration building, where it was located for more than 30 years before moving to the new building this fall. The new building is complete with divisions and laboratories covering every phase of modern home economics.",
