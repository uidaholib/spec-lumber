For thirty-five years our campus has been home for the man who has earned the world over the very appropriate but non-professional title of Mr. Flotation. For twenty-one of those years Arthur W. Fahrenwald has been dean of our College of Mines and director of the Idaho State Bureau of Mines and Geology. New processes and new machines growing out of his research here are now in use in every mining district throughout the world. It is safe to say that 75 percent of all the ore treated by flotation goes through processes and machinery having their origin in his research at Idaho. The world over, flotation and Fahrenwald have became synonymous. many times he has been called to mining districts abroad to help on some special metallurgical problem. Through his contribution to more efficient and economical mineral recovery, millions of dollars have been added to the income of Idaho's mining industry throughout the world. \"To you, Dean Fahrenwald, by authority of the Regents, it is a pleasure and an honor to present with hearty congratulations and best wishes this certificate of merit and appointment emeritus effective upon your retirement from your deanship, 1 September 1954.\" J. E. Buchanan, President.",
