Robinson also discusses Jesus as the most qualified to reveal what god is and draws attention to poor translations of Jesus' words by average men: God is not 'a spirit' but that God 'is spirit.' He defines God as 'a presence' and 'a dynamic power in the universe,' giving examples of how the force that God is works on earth.",
