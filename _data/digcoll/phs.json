The two generators and Parsons type steam turbines were built by Westinghouse. One unit, serial No. 801, was rated at 625 K.V.A the other with serial No. 766, was rated at 1000 K. V. A. Both operating at 600 volts, 3-phase, 60 cycles and 3,600 R.P.M. After Elk River was closed down the larger unit was moved andinstalled at the Potlatch mill, and was then reqired to suppply 2400 volts. Originally the each cost around $17 and $20,000.00.",

In the right foreground is the Potlatch Mercantile building with the outside walls barely up. In the foreground is the old ranch house, barn and outbuildings that were there when Deary purchased the land in June 1905. Note the outhouse, lower right.'",
