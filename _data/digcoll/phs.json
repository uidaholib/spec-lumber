The two generators and Parsons type steam turbines were built by Westinghouse. One unit, serial No. 801, was rated at 625 K.V.A the other with serial No. 766, was rated at 1000 K. V. A. Both operating at 600 volts, 3-phase, 60 cycles and 3,600 R.P.M. After Elk River was closed down the larger unit was moved andinstalled at the Potlatch mill, and was then reqired to suppply 2400 volts. Originally the each cost around $17 and $20,000.00.",

The paper in the upper right corner describes the contest: \"When the Lone Jack Steak Company opened in October 1993, co-owner Irene Bain devised the Mystery Family Contest to promote the new restaurant located at the junction of Highway 95 and Highway 6 in Potlatch. As the promotion developed, Irene (and later Barbara Coyner) interviewed families who had a history in the area, and went through old photos with them, scanning copies of the photos, combining them with a narrative. The Palouse newspaper then published the narrative and a picture or two in the paper, minus the last name of the family. People were to guess who the family was and submit their entry. Winners got a $25 gift certificate. The contest was a huge hit and people got excited about knowing who the family was. Once each contest was over, the narrative and pictures were mounted in frames and hung on the walls of the restaurant. When the Lone Jack closed permanently, the Mystery Family Collection was donated to the Potlatch Historical Society. The various family histories are displayed as they were originally written.\"  ",
