(Logging of consequence did not begin in the Clearwater until 1926). Many and dire were the predications of what would happen when the girls went to work in the camps, but aside from a sizeable number of school teacher lumberjack marriages and a noticeable sprucing up by all the men in the camps, nothing much happened. The girl flunkeys have worked efficiently and well. A tendency to move about and to not stay in any one camp for more than a few months sometimes weeks, is evident among them. The beckoning finger of other jobs provides a well nigh [sic] irrestible lure with a resulting high turnover of flunkey labor, but, nevertheless they have performed a fine war job.\" Description taken from back of photograph.",

He didn't make it, in fact was sprawled half-out and half-in the pit when the tree came to rest. Lang is bent over brushing snow from his clothing in the bottom of the pit.

Lines were anchored on opposite piers and by means of a winch, driven by the donkey, the barge was pulled back and forth over the logs and ice. the old barge was plenty heavy with its steel plated bottom and upward beveled ends to do the ice breaking job. in fact it kept getting heavier as the water from the pond seeped through cracks in its sides and finally one night disappeared from view under the waters of the pond.
