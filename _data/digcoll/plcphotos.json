Although women flunkeys were used in logging camps during World War I, none were employed at camps in the Clearwater forests until the summer of 1942. (Logging of consequence did not begin in the Clearwater until 1926). Many and dire were the predications of what would happen when the girls went to work in the camps, but aside from a sizeable number of school teacher lumberjack marriages and a noticeable sprucing up by all the men in the camps, nothing much happened. The girl flunkeys have worked efficiently and well. A tendency to move about and to not stay in any one camp for more than a few months sometimes weeks, is evident among them. The beckoning finger of other jobs provides a well nigh [sic] irrestible lure with a resulting high turnover of flunkey labor, but, nevertheless they have performed a fine war job.'

The falling tree may twist a little to one side or the other as it falls, or hit another tree and roll sharply to one side, and the butt of the tree may swing in either direction with sufficient force to kill a man if it hits him. For quick escape from the pit saw gangs generally notch steps in the side of the pit. in the picture below sawyers Lang and Jones are shown still in the pit after the tree topples over. it fell a bit quicker than was expected with the result that the men were unable to escape from the pit. the snow on Jones coat was caused by his attempt to hastily scramble out of the pit. He didn't make it, in fact was sprawled half-out and half-in the pit when the tree came to rest. Lang is bent over brushing snow from his clothing in the bottom of the pit. Fortunately for the men this particular tree fell straight away and the butt did not jump to either side.'",

It had stopped snowing (temporarily) and a big rotary plow had finally completed plowing out the railroad between Headquarters and Orofino after a several days plug-up because of too much snow. P.F.I. Railroad crews were not so fortunate and the wing plows used to push snow from the tracks leading from Headquarters to camps 27, 29, 14, 51 and 52 were unable to keep the snow off the rails. Camp 14 was finally closed early n February. Snow between the rails rolled up ball-like to derail locomotives, forcing one delay after another, and many are the stories related by lumberjacks of log flats that failed to take a curve because of packed snow between the rails and simply continued out into the timber instead of down the railroad right-of-way.'",

Lines were anchored on opposite piers and by means of a winch, driven by the donkey, the barge was pulled back and forth over the logs and ice. the old barge was plenty heavy with its steel plated bottom and upward beveled ends to do the ice breaking job. in fact it kept getting heavier as the water from the pond seeped through cracks in its sides and finally one night disappeared from view under the waters of the pond. Next morning only the smokestack of the donkey engine was visible. However, the ice breaker was speedily salvaged and returned to service.'",
