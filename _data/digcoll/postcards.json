        "description": "Postcard is a photograph from the rubble remains of the mining town of Vienna in the Sawtooth National Forest, Idaho. | The Old Vienna Mine (The Place to go is Idaho) This famous mining area was opened in 1879. By 1883 a twenty stamp mill was turning out between forty and fifty thousand dollars worth of ore per month. It continued this production until 1885 when a Lawsuit closed the property. In 1917 the Old Vienna Co. reacquired control over the Mines, built a new Mill, and camp, but to no avail. The Mill never ran and the area, which had produced over five hundred thousand dollars worth of Silver, sank into ruin.",

The hotel was never finished and was dismantled for use in several depots. 15,000 bricks were used to build this chateau-like depot, which has stood as a focal point in Wallace since 1902. It is now owned and operated by the Burlington Northern Railroad, and was featured in the popular movie \"Heaven's Gate,\" part of which was filmed in Wallace.",

Twenty-two prospectors from Pierce discovered the Elk City Mines in May 1861, and a Gold Rush followed that summer. Permanent log buildings were begun August 6 and within a month about 40 stores, saloons, and cabins were ready for winter use. Most of the miners rushed off to other new bonanzas that falls, but Elk City still became one of the important Idaho Gold Camps.",

These dredges recall the gold years between the early 30'a and late 50's, when they were seen on many Idaho stream beds. Huge mouths full of gravel were screened down to the fine and heavier gold. These huge machines have disappeared because of (1) the price of gold, pegged in the early 30's, (2) present necessity of grooming worked stream beds, and (3) the diminishing number of unworked gravel beds.",
