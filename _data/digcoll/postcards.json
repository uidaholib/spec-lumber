The hotel was never finished and was dismantled for use in several depots. 15,000 bricks were used to build this chateau-like depot, which has stood as a focal point in Wallace since 1902. It is now owned and operated by the Burlington Northern Railroad, and was featured in the popular movie \"\"Heaven's Gate,\"\" part of which was filmed in Wallace.",

She plans to attend the University of Idaho to major in political science and pre-law. Louise was photographed in an original designed ceremonial dress of the Bannock tribe, with the Big Horn Mountains in the background. She will reign over the 1973 All American Indian Days and Miss Indian America pageant to be held in Sheridan, Wyoming, July 27, 28, 29.",
