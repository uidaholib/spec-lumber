He is still a claimant for this land, and is now employed as a Railway mail Clerk working out of Spokane, Washington. An attempt to secure valuable timber land under homestead laws without even a colorable showing as to residence, cultivation or improvements. Purely a speculative venture. See his testimony before the Idaho Legislative Homestead Committee.' Note: Marble Creek region homesteads at this time were often part of a homesteads fraud being documented by the US Forest Service.",

His residence has never prevented his continuous presence at his employment in the bank. Note the height of the roof against which a man is leaning. Photo taken in fall of 1905. Leuschel located October 25, 1901. He is a man with a family who have never seen their 'Home' in Marble Creek. After holding the claim from 1901 or 1911 under his own name, on November25, 1911, he filed a soldier's additional claim on the land in the name of Henery H. Holstein. Final certificate was issued August 8, 1914. He declares before the Idaho Legislative Homestead Commission that he desired the land for a home. His assertion is not borne out by his subsequent acts.' Note: Marble Creek region homesteads at this time were often part of a homesteads fraud being documented by the US Forest Service.",
