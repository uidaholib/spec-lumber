CPT and regional I-0 address different facets of the· regional structure. CPT explains the spatial structure of regions, the size and location of settlements in space. Regional I-0 explains the structure of regional inter industry trade. CPT has advanced in a primarily formal literature. In contrast, regional I-0 is a highly applied technology, with many of its more prominent advances resulting from empirical exercises.",

        "description": "Wheat import demands of the former Soviet Union (FSU) greatly influenced the volume of wheat trade and prices after the Soviets entered into the world wheat market as a consistent, but variable, buyer in the seventies and eighties. Wheat imports, which typically have accounted for half of the former Soviet Union's grain imports, peaked in 1984 at approximately 25% of global wheat trade. The world food economy is confronted with a new era following the collapse of central planning and single-party communism in the former Soviet republics. Arguments that the former Soviet Republics may cease or reverse their role as a continuous deficit region have been reviewed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impacts of the former Soviet Union's withdrawing from the world wheat market on world trade and prices and to analyze the effects of random fluctuations in FSU's wheat production on the world wheat market. While the simulated impact on average price levels is significant, price trends at the turn of the century are shown to depend on other economic parameters. The stochastic simulation suggests that the former Soviet region will play a moderately important role in the year-to-year behavior of the world wheat economy even if long-term self-sufficiency is achieved.",

From this survey, it was found that respondents want to  reduce the share of tax revenues paid through property taxes. They prefer to increase support for infrastructure and schools and reduce corrections and social service expenditures. They trust the effectiveness of local government more than state government. They favor increased revenue sharing to local governments funded through sales taxes. They view the sales tax as the most fair of the taxes in Idaho. They are equally divided over the options of increasing the sales tax rate, extending the base to personal consumption services, and/or eliminating production equipment exemptions. The respondents revealed preference for public finance reform includes the following. First, reduce state government expenditures on corrections and social services (support 60-76%). Second, return the saved resources from these programs to local governments as additional revenue sharing funds (support 64%). Third, local government uses one portion of these funds to increase spending on public education and infrastructure (support 71-72%) . Forth, they use the other portion to reduce property taxes (support 60%). Finally, this program of restructuring is presented and explained to citizens through the media (support 78%)",

        "date": "1993-01-05",
        "description": "The Idaho State Tax Commission estimated that the property tax revenue loss to county, school, city, highway, and other tax districts from the One-percent Initiative would have been $114 million for 1991. $31 million of the $114 million would have been lost from county government revenues. Supporters of the One Percent Initiative maintain that these estimates over-states the property tax reduction for 1993 because in two years, if the tax base grows faster than the local government expenditures, then property tax rates will be lower in two years time. Consequently, the one-percent maximum tax rate restriction on property will be less revenue reducing. Beyond this, the proponents of the One Percent Initiative argue, as long as the growth in the tax base is greater than the growth in expenditures, then local government can 'grow out' of any reduction in property tax revenues given enough time.",

        "description": "If the Idaho One-percent Initiative (1994 version) had been in effect in 1993, county, school, city, highway, and other tax districts would have lost $204 million in property tax revenue according to the Idaho State Tax Commission. County government alone would have lost $68 million in property tax revenue, a third of the $204 million reduction. In 1992, supporters of the One-percent Initiative maintained that the Tax Commission estimates over-states the property tax reduction because proponents believed the tax base would grow faster than the local government expenditures. As a result, property tax rates would be lower, so the One-percent restrictions would be less revenue reducing in two years time, the earliest the initiative could take effect. Beyond this, the proponents of the One-percent Initiative argued, as long as the growth in the tax base is greater than the growth in expenditures, then local government would .. grow out .. of any reduction in property tax revenues given enough time. By opponents of the One-percent Initiative, the reverse argument was made.",

        "description": "The public expects increased services provided by counties along with the lowest possible tax burden. County governments need accurate and complete information to improve local public finance decision making. To improve local fiscal policy talking Tom Johnson and his graduate students at Virginia Polytechnic Institute developed a micro computer based fiscal impact model. The model provides decision makers a method to simulate the impacts of various demographic, fiscal, and economic changes in the community. Researchers at the University of Idaho's Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology are adapting the Virginia model for Idaho counties.",

        "description": "Since 1938 anadromous fish have had to navigate past the dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. The U.S. Army Crops of Engineers has maintained fish ladders and counting facilities at these dams, and has provided an annual count of the numbers of fish by major species since 1938. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has contracted with the Washington Department of Wildlife to do fish counting. The species of fish counted and included in this study include chinook and sockeye salmon, and steelhead trout. Over the years the number of fish counted annually has varied greatly. This variation is related to a number of factors such as the cycle of spawning, river and ocean conditions, and a number of other factors which are not well understood. Among these factors is the ability of particular species to respond to changing environmental conditions. These environmental conditions include both freshwater and salt water factors . In the freshwater situation, spawning habitat, downstream and upstream fish passage, and the mainstream predation environment, and the fresh water harvest are all factors to be considered. In the salt water environment the off shore ocean fishery, El Nin'o, and predation are factors. Additionally, some mature fish return to spawn after one year (jacks), some after two years, some after 3 years, some after four years, and some after 5 years. This variability is reflected in the fish counts and appears as the peaks and valleys on the charts which follow.",

        "description": "The conservation compliance provisions of the 1985 Farm Bill have decreased average erosion by more than 50% in the Tom Bealle watershed of Northern Idaho, as estimated from profit-maximizing mathematical programming models and erosion predictions using Geographic Information System (GIS) data. Requiring reduced tillage in order to participate in the farm · program resulted in an average of 6. 6 tons of erosion per acre for cultivated areas in the watershed, compared to 13.5 tons without conservation compliance provisions. Interestingly, using the original mandate of requiring that farmers not exceed 'T' increased erosion to an average of 8.9 tons per acre for the watershed, as only 38% of profit-maximizing farmers would choose to participate in the farm program. Even if the maximum erosion level permitted were raised to 1.5 times 'T,' average erosion was predicted to be 8.6 tons per acre, as only 85% of farmers would participate. The use of alternative conservation systems reduced overall erosion more effectively than a strict erosion limit as farmers did not exit the farm program due to inability to reach erosion limits while maintaining profitability.",

        "description": "Adverse weather factors in India augment the instability in wheat supply and trade. Consequently, India's wheat trade is a classic example of stochastic supply being the dominant factor in determining trade flows. This study analyses the effects of random fluctuations in India's wheat supply on domestic and world price variability and trade flows of India and major exporters and importers by using stochastic simulation analysis. Production instability causes price variability of $71 per metric ton under autarky condition. However, price variability is mitigated once trade is allowed. Thus, trade acts as a buffer stock program in reducing price variability. The results show that production shortfalls (surpluses) in India benefit wheat exporters (importers) and hurt importers (exporters).",

The records of the fish passage have a story of their own to tell, and this paper attempts to shed some light on what has happened since the first dam was built and made operational in 1938. The focus of this study is directed toward the eight dams built on the Columbia River and Snake rivers between 1938 and 1975. The fish run records evaluated extend from 1938 to 1994. The study is divided into three parts. The first part deals with the impact of the Columbia River dams on fish runs. The second part deals with the impact of the Snake River dams on fish runs. And, the third part deals with the overall results of dam construction on these fish runs.",

        "creator": "Dailey, Patricia; Cooke, Stephen",
        "date": "1994-02-21",
        "description": "In Idaho, federal forest and rangelands are 63% of the total area. The issues are whether federal compensation to local governments to support public services equals the private tax revenue forgone and whether this compensation changes with a change in resource use. Using tax equivalency ratios, the results shows that Idaho's local governments in 1991 were no worse off, on average, with public lands remaining in public ownership. Federal compensation returned more on forest than on grazing land. These results are sensitive to assumptions about forest land productivity. Measures of 'use equivalency' showed that federal compensation formulas created a financial self-interest for local government officials in extractive uses of public lands to maximize federal compensation received. Federal PILTs do not offset revenue sharing losses on a 1:1 bases as resource uses change. Senate bill S. 455 that changes the PILT funding levels is one example of a policy change that would help break the current structure of incentives that favor extractive uses of public land resources in Idaho.",

        "description": "The title raises an interesting question that has several ramifications. First, how many farmers can afford to leave the farm program given the current unstable level of commodity prices? In the 1990 Food Security Act (FSA) all the economic benefits of the federal farm program are linked to conservation compliance. It seems more realistic to approach the topic of FSA survival by looking at the costs and benefits of participation. To do this the short-run and long-run economic impacts both on and off the farm have to be evaluated. FSA attempts to reduce the economic and environmental impacts of erosion by requiring farmers to use approved conservation practices on highly erodible lands. The way chosen to do this is to tie the farm program benefits to the use of a Soil Conservation Service approved conservation plan. The carrot used to make the pill easier to swallow is continuation of farm program benefits. The stick or penalty is the loss of all farm program benefits.",

Specifically, subsidized production of quota A and B sugar will show small decline and unsubsidized production of quota C, which receives the world price, will increase. The decline in EU's sugar exports will be less than the EU's commitment of reducing subsidized exports by 340,000 MT because increase in unsubsidized exports from quota C production is expected to compensate the decline in subsidized exports.",

However, due to significant increases in production per cow, total milk production increased by 98 percent over the same period (Idaho Agricultural Statistics 1991). Cash receipts from milk accounted for 12 percent of all cash proceeds from farm marketings in 1991 (Idaho Agricultural Statistics 1991): Milk receipts surpassed those of wheat in 1984, and milk presently ranks third in the state in terms of income received by farmers.

For example, Sumner elaborated 'NAFTA promises positive gains' for the U.S. sugar industry because: a) access to the Mexican market will improve; b) U.S. production is more efficient than that of Mexico; and c) higher income growth in Mexico resulting from NAFTA will stimulate consumption of sugar.",

        "description": "The continued growth and specialization of U.S. farms means that increasingly higher levels of management skill are required. In addition, the relatively unstable markets of recent years, heightened government regulation of agriculture, and rapidly changing production technologies have also increased the information needs of producers (Ortman, et al.). As a result, American farmers are increasingly utilizing the services of technical consultants to improve the productivity and profitability of their operations. Consultants ·provide services to producers in many aspects of farm management, including production decisions, marketing choices, and financial planning. Consultants offer specialized knowledge that would otherwise be difficult for producers to obtain.",

        "description": "The importance of agricultural exports to United States agriculture and our position in the international economy has been recognized at least from the 1970's. Consequently maritime shipping issues as they relate to US agricultural trade have received the attention of agricultural economists on several occasions (e.g. Jones, Qu, Casavant & Koo, 1995; Casavant & Wilson, 1991; Makus & Fuller, 1987; Jones, Casavant & Kim, 1986; Binkley, 1983; Binkley and Harrer, 1981; Sharp & McDonald, 1971 ). At the same time the international maritime community follows US and world agricultural trade trends closely since grains in particular rank along with coal, iron ore, and steel as one of the industry's most important dry bulk cargoes (Drewry).",
