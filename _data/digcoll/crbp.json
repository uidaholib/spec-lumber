This aerial view of the Grand Coulee Dam area shows the status of progress on the construction of Grand Coulee pumping plant and feeder canal. The pumping plant is being constructed behind the 600-foot long wing dam extending to the left from near the west abutment end of Grand Coulee Dam. The world's largest pumps will be installed in the pumping plant at a level of 120 feet below the roadway elevation. Each pump will lift water 280 feet from Roosevelt Lake and will discharge it through a steel pipe 12 feet in diameter and about 680 feet in length. Twelve tunnels, from 487 to 530 feet in length, will carry the pipes under the highway and up through the granite canyon wall. Upon emerging from the tunnels, as do the three pipes on the right, they will continue on concrete piers for about 260 feet and discharge into the headworks for the feeder canal. Excavation of the feeder canal has been completed to the cut-and -cover section and is ready for concrete lining.",

Dworshak Dam will be a concrete gravity dam with an initial power production potentially of 400,000 kilowatts from three generators. Three additional generators can be added later to boost the power output to 1,060,000 kilowatts. Dworshak dam will create a reservoir storing 3,454,000 acre-feet of water and will add substantially to the prime power production of hydroelectric plants downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. Also, it will serve a vital role in flood control on the Clearwater, which has wide fluctuations in flow during the year. The Dworshak reservoir will be approximately 53 miles long. Congress appropriated $600,000 in planning funds in 1961 and in 1962 Congress appropriated $2,000,000 in construction funds. Start of construction began April, 1963, with building of access roads to the project.",

Shown in the lower part of the picture is the 15-acre newly prepared business section created by the artificial fill to elevation above the reservoir. The buildings in the center of the picture are not scheduled for demolishing until May 1967; however, access to the present temporary business district will be practically cut off once traffic is diverted across the new Interstate 80 bridge. With creating the John Day reservoir, the water will inundate the present temporary business section occupied by the buildings, and the new Arlington will be provided with a quay-type waterfront. The huge fill riverward is being used as a disposal center for rock and earth being removed in the grading of Interstate Highway 80 along the south-shore cliffs.",

A view of the process of mounting the stiffener rings on the discharge pipe with the aid of a compressed air-activated bull press. Rings are fabricated from quarter segments, with one joint being welded to the pipe as temporary lugs to keep the ring in alignment. 'The Bull' presses the ring into firm contact with the pipe and it is tack welded with a 4 inch fillet weld. The pipe is revolved approximately one foot by the positioning rollers, and the process is repeated until the ring is entirely tack welded. The pipe will then be rolled down the line to an automatic welder set-up (picture 18532-3) where a full fillet weld will be placed on both sides of the stiffener rings to complete the pipe for placing in the tunnel.",

Lowering this 450 ton wheel into place, the operators of the two powerhouse cranes, that jointly supported the load, were guided by workmen, stationed around the rim, who inserted sticks between the stationary and moving parts to measure the clearance and prevent contact. When the unit goes into service next February, the outer rim of this rotor, which is 7 feet high, will spin at 125 miles per hour. Attached to the rim are 52 magnets, weighing 3300 lbs. each.",

Before being poured in concrete, the scroll case is given hydraulic test of 310 pounds to the square inch.  This scroll case, designed for use at Shasta Dam in northern California, is temporarily installed at Grand Coulee Dam by order of the War Production Board, as construction at Shasta Dam had not progressed sufficiently to make immediate use of turbine at that point. With the waters of the mighty Columbia River as a driving force, this turbine now installed is spinning a giant generator at a rate of 138.5 revolutions per minute, producing more than 75,000 kilowatts of electrical energy.",

The bolts will be inserted in these openings, and the nuts, weighing 37 pounds each, attached. To tighten these, a huge steel wrench, three feet long, turned by the blows from a heavy sledge hammer, will be used. Before being seated, the bolts will be cooled to 80 below zero, and shrunk, in a compartment filled with dry ice. While in their contracted form, they will be inserted in the openings in the flanges of the shaft. When their temperature again rises and matches that of the surrounding atmosphere, the fit will be as near perfect as engineers are able to make it.",

Eight of these needle valves, transferred from Boulder Dam, are being temporarily installed in the turbine pits by use of steel reducers (elbows) joining the valve with the 18-foot in diameter penstock tubes. A portion of the stream flow of the Columbia River is to be passed through those needle valves during the low water season. The flow through the needle valves, in addition to that portion of the river flow passing through the turbines in the left powerhouse will make unnecessary the use of the spillway. This program of diversion will provide a minimum of turbulence in the water at the foot of the spillway section, facilitating future repair work to the concrete bucket or trough at the base of the spillway. At some future date, the needle valves will be replaced by 150,000 horsepower hydro-turbines, designed to propel 108,000 kilowatt hydroelectric generators.",

        "description": "North Coulee Dam, Piezometer Terminal Well, A view of the piezometer test apparatus at the corner of the upstream and right walls of the well. The pore pressure in the dam embankment and foundation are transmitted through the water-filled tubes and recorded on the Bourdon tube pressure gages at the right. The solenoid operated valve at the top transmits pulsating waves through the system to assist in the removal of air in the tubes. Two TK Westinghouse relays at the bottom are electrically connected in series with the solenoid valve. Any cycle desired for the operation of solenoid valve can be obtained by adjustments of the timing devices in the relays. The air trap at the upper left supplies water and removes air from the system. Specifications 2586, Contract I2r-18481, J.A. Terteling and Sons, Inc., Contractor.",
