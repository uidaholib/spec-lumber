Just below this is the location of the structure to be as you will later see. The little foot bridge across the river went over to the Merry place. People who lived on the little farm that you will note. The road went from Orofino to Dent, upstream some 20 miles. In far distance, downstream, you will see Ahsahka (just a little of it) and the Riverside area of what became later a part of Orofino.\"\"",

It was to be an Army construction type of bridge and we were working with the State Highway  to get it to be a bridge for public use. Army wanted it to haul  cement and route for workers to come to the job- a saving for labor transportation, etc. The state was to put some money into it and make it a public bridge, the Army wanted to tear it down after construction. To make a long story short, the state was willing but the Army backed out of the deal and elected to divert the travel across the bridge at Orofino rather than go to the expense of a new bridge. The markings are Army. This shows the forks of the river well. (A.B. Curtis)\"\"",
