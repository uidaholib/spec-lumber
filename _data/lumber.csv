The hands said: since I must do all the work and earn all the money to keep the rest of you going, I should be boss. The eyes said: since I must look out for all of you and tell you where the danger lurks, I should be boss. And so it went with the heart, the ears, the lungs, at least the asshole spoke up and demanded to be boss. All the other parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being boss. The asshole was so angered that he blocked himself off and refused to function. Soon the brain was feverish, the eyes crossed and ached, the feet were too weak to walk; the hands hung limply at the side; the heart and lungs struggled to keep going. All pleaded with the brain to let the asshole be boss. AND SO IT HAPPENED, all the other parts did all the work and the asshole just bossed and passed out a lot of shit.

Death: (Other than your own)....This is no excuse...there is nothing you can do for them, and we feel sure that someone else with a lesser position can attend to the arrangements. However, if the funeral can be held in the late afternoon, we will be glad to let you off 30 minutes early, provided that your share of the work is ahead enough to keep the business going in your absense. Leave of absense: (For an operation)...we will no longer allow this practice. We wish to discourage any thoughts that you might need an operation as we believe that as long as you are an employee here you will need all of whatever you have, and you should not consider having anything removed. We hired you as you are and therefore, anything removed would certainly make you less than we bargained for. Death: (Your Own)....This will be accepted as an excuse. But, we would like a two-week notice as we feel it is your duty to train someone else to do your job.
