Ott Collection,looking east at Second Street from Main Street in Moscow,1902,yes,,"Part of the Browne Block shows at the northeast corner of Second and Main streets. History of the building follows. [90-2-0054] Preserving Moscow's Past. The Latah County Abstract and Title Guarantee Company began business in 1888. It was part of the Browne Building erected during the 1880s. The company was established by I.C. Hattabaugh, Nez Perce County recorder, who held the office until Latah County was divided from Nez Perce in 1888. The Moscow National Bank occupied the front part of the building until it closed down in 1896. In 1890 Hattabaugh sold his interest in the company to a Mr. Veatch and a Mr. Woodworth, who in turn sold out to a Mr. S.R.H. McGowan in 1894. C.L. Thompson, who operated the Idaho Realty and Trust Company on the site of what is now the Nobby Inn, merged with Mr. Woodworth in 1911, and the company was renamed Latah County Trust Company. Thompson built the company vault, which is one of the largest private vaults in Idaho, according to his grandson, Tod Kiblen, who now runs the company. The vault houses every property transaction in Latah county and dates back to the government patents in the 1870s. The outside of the building is being restored by Hamilton Enterprises of Coeur d'Alene. The second story windows have been replaced, paint over the original bricks has been cleaned away and the mortar in between the bricks replaced. The pictures show the building as it appeared in 1896, and a recent photo of the fireplace, which is built of oak and has been carefully looked after and preserved.

America, America, Smog smears its grays on thee; We stain thy prime with soot and grime And strontium ninety!

America, America, On bureaucrats cry shame; For canyons dammed and us flim-flamm'd In Reclamation's name! (Verse 3) O beautiful for scenery Black'd out by billboard's span; For nauseious stink of sew'rs we drink Where once pure rivers ran. America, America, What thieves thy people by, Who rob from earth their children's birth Right, Nature's legacy! (Verse 4) O beautiful for neon sign By big dam power lit; For carrion of countless cars On hillside charnel pit. America, America, Whom ev'ry gully robs; Thy landscape slopped with litter dropped By (let us face it) slobs! (Verse 5) O beautiful for highways broad, With beer cans tightly hemm'd; For marshes drained and dollars gained And water fowl condemn'd.

The brain said: since I control everything do all the thinking, I should be boss. The feet said: since I do carry man where he wants to go and get him in position to do what the brain wants, I should be boss. The hands said: since I must do all the work and earn all the money to keep the rest of you going, I should be boss. The eyes said: since I must look out for all of you and tell you where the danger lurks, I should be boss. And so it went with the heart, the ears, the lungs, at least the asshole spoke up and demanded to be boss. All the other parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being boss. The asshole was so angered that he blocked himself off and refused to function. Soon the brain was feverish, the eyes crossed and ached, the feet were too weak to walk; the hands hung limply at the side; the heart and lungs struggled to keep going. All pleaded with the brain to let the asshole be boss. AND SO IT HAPPENED, all the other parts did all the work and the asshole just bossed and passed out a lot of shit.

Subject: NEW SICK LEAVE POLICY. Sickness: No excuse...we will no longer accept your doctor's statement as proof, as we believe that if you are able to go to the doctor, you are able to come to work. Death: (Other than your own)....This is no excuse...there is nothing you can do for them, and we feel sure that someone else with a lesser position can attend to the arrangements. However, if the funeral can be held in the late afternoon, we will be glad to let you off 30 minutes early, provided that your share of the work is ahead enough to keep the business going in your absense. Leave of absense: (For an operation)...we will no longer allow this practice. We wish to discourage any thoughts that you might need an operation as we believe that as long as you are an employee here you will need all of whatever you have, and you should not consider having anything removed. We hired you as you are and therefore, anything removed would certainly make you less than we bargained for. Death: (Your Own)....This will be accepted as an excuse. But, we would like a two-week notice as we feel it is your duty to train someone else to do your job.
