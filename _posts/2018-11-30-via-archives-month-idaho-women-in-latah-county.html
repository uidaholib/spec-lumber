 <p>Archives Month Idaho: Women in Latah County</p>
 <p>2018-11-30</p>
 <p>During this year’s Archives Month, the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/">University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives</a> hosted a presentation on October 24th about women in Latah County during World War I. The presentation complimented this semester’s exhibit, At War! The Impact of World War I on the University of Idaho 100 Years Later, which coincided with the centennial of Armistice Day on November 11<sup>th</sup>.</p>
 <p>Historian Sandra Kelly explained the charge of local Red Cross chapters and their growth following the declaration of war in April 1917. The Red Cross played a crucial role in the home front movement during WWI. Women in Latah County, home to the University of Idaho, quickly joined in the fight and the local Red Cross chapters made an immediate impact.</p>
 <p>Kelly spoke about the balance between home and volunteering as local women spent hours knitting clothing for soldiers as well as rolling bandages, collecting books and helping with fundraisers to provide needed monies to purchase personal supplies and materials to send to soldiers. The information provided during the presentation used primary sources from the University of Idaho and local repositories, such as the <a href="https://www.latahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/">Latah County Historical Society</a>.</p>
 <p>The presentation was well attended by people from the University and community members. Everyone enjoyed refreshments provided by the Northwest Archivists National Archives Month award. All were grateful for the generous support of our Archives Month event!</p>
