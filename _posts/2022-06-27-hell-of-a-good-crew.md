The Sunshine Mine located in northern Idaho's Shoshone county was once the most profitable silver mine in the state. Discovered in 1884 by the Blake brothers, they mined their claim for two decades before leasing to other people. The Sunshine Mining Company was officially created in 1918 and closed in 2001, producing over 360 million ounces of silver.
