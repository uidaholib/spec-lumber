Incorporated in 1906, the National Copper Mining Company consisted of 8 mining claims and one mill site, shown here 5 years after its first demise after steadily declining production. National Copper held on with renewed stock options following a purchase of nearby developments in the 1920s, however, until the final dissolution of the corporation in 1943. </p><blockquote class="bg-light pt-1 px-4 font-italic"><p>PG 8-x761, National Copper Mill, Mullan, Idaho, 5/10/1925. <br/></p></blockquote>
