<p>Over the last several months weâ€™ve had to remain socially distant from our campus, staggering schedules, limited in our ability to perform reference, and missing our Vandal friends and family. This week we all return fully to campus (with precautions). Most of our Special Collections staff will be back in the office ready to answer any reference questions you may have.</p>

<p>Do you have questions about viewing materials? Make an appointment and check out our <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/rules.html">new guidelines here</a>.</p>
