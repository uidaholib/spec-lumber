At that time, he was just 5 years into his career as a jazz musician. Now, 23 years later, we are thrilled to have him back, this time with his “Still Dreaming” Quartet. </p><p>To see more images from his 1997 performance be sure to stop by the display cases in the Kibbie Dome during the festival. </p><p>Photo courtesy of the Jazz Office records, UA 2016-29</p>
