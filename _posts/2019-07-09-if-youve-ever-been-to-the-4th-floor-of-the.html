 <p>If you’ve ever been to the 4th floor of the library, you may or may not have noticed some empty display cases. Well, they are empty no more! Seeing as it’s been 50 years since the Stonewall riots in Manhattan, we thought it would be nice to display some books from our Stonewall Collection. On display we have books that have either won, or were nominated, for the Stonewall Book Award.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>According to the ALA website, the Stonewall Book Award honors books with&nbsp;“exceptional merit relating to the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender experience.” First awarded in 1971, the award has grown to include three categories: literature, non-fiction, and children’s and young adult literature, as well as several honor books.&nbsp;</p>
