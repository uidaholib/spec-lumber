In
celebration of October’s designation as National Cookbook Month we are
featuring  <i>Favorite Recipes of Moscow Ladies</i> published in 1896<i>. </i>The book is part of the Day-Northwest
Collection<i> </i>found in the University of
Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives. For Fall, we thought a couple
of nice soup recipes would be just the thing. </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1659" data-orig-width="1545"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/166366255553_0.jpg" data-orig-height="1659" data-orig-width="1545"/></figure><p>The cookbook contains recipes from members of the Ladies Aid
Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Moscow, Idaho. The front cover
declared it was a cook book “containing the choicest recipes for economical and
practical housekeeping. Another cookbook found in the Day-Northwest Collection
is <i>Choice Recipes</i> published in 1931
by the Hospitality Committee of the Presbyterian Ladies Aid of the Presbyterian
Church in Moscow. This cookbook also offers some warm, filling soup recipes. <br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2400" data-orig-width="1554"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/166366255553_1.jpg" data-orig-height="2400" data-orig-width="1554"/></figure><p>The Day-Northwest Collection consists of published materials
