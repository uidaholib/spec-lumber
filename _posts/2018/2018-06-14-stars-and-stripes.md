President Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation in 1916 observing June 14 as Flag Day but it was not until August of 1949 that President Harry Truman signed legislation creating an annual observance every June 14. In 1966, Congress requested the president also issue a proclamation each year naming the week in which June 14 falls each year as National Flag Week.
