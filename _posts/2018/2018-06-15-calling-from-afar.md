In today’s [Archives Outdoors](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/archivesoutdoors.html), Bob Tondevold surveys the land and air and reports back using a ‘Littlefone’ from atop Bald Mountain in south-central Idaho, near Sun Valley. From the caption on back: "This is terrain which offers ‘radar shows’ and potential invasion path to enemy. Tondevold uses hand-carried battery-operated transmitter with which he can call in aircraft spotting information."
