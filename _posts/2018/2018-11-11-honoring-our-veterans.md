In 1941, Congress approved the creation of the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), later replaced by the Women’s Army Corps (WAC), ensuring women who served in support of the Army would be afforded all the rights and benefits of soldiers.

Of the women who enlisted in WAC to serve their country, nearly 800 of them were Native Americans. This picture of Elizabeth Allen, a Nez Perce woman, was taken in Des Moines, Iowa in 1943. Fort Des Moines was one of the first training centers for the WAAC. (PG 100_394)

We would like to give a large thank you to all the veterans who have served!
