<p>Another time honored tradition of University of Idaho Homecoming is the annual serpentine. Taking place Friday October 19, led by the Sound of Idaho Marching Band, this year the Serpentine will wind through Old Greek and New Greek Rows, to the VandalStore, along Sixth Street, through the residence halls and up to the Kibbie Dome parking lot. Gather outside living groups on campus and join in the fun as these students did in 1961.</p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="1548" data-orig-width="1247"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/179122208113_0.jpg" data-orig-height="1548" data-orig-width="1247"/></figure><p>The twisty, turny fun of the serpentine begins at 8 p.m. and will end in the Kibbie Dome parking lot where it will be followed by the traditional Homecoming bonfire and fireworks!<br/></p>
