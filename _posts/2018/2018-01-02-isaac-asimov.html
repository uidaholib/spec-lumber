<p>Happy Birthday to the late great Isaac Asimov, born January 2nd, 1920. We have many works created by or related to him in our new science fiction collection, including a large assortment of Isaac Asimovâ€™s Science Fiction Magazine. In 1977 he lent his name to the magazine and wrote material up until his death in 1992.</p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="2978" data-orig-width="3720"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/169239959163_0.jpg" data-orig-height="2978" data-orig-width="3720"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="3031" data-orig-width="3933"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/169239959163_1.jpg" data-orig-height="3031" data-orig-width="3933"/></figure>
