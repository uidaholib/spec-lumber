Equal opportunity isnâ€™t always the first thought to come to mind when looking at historic mining collections, however with the Option Mining Company, typical gender occupations of 1925 seem to be reversed when Mrs. Lorena K. Stratton was elected chairman/president and Mr. William J. Stratton secretary. Presumably they make up the company Stratton and Stratton said to hold the original mining interest that became the Option, and in whose office the first meeting of stockholders took place. Were they husband and wife? Brother and sister-in-law? Mother and son? Yet another unknown mystery and potential research project.
