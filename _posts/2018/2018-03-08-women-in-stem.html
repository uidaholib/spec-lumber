Shreeve. Since
arriving in 1961, Dr. Shreeve has 
















established
a reputation as a world authority on fluorine chemistry, published more than 500 scholarly
journal articles, and served on numerous boards and committees, including as Chair of the President’s Committee on the National Medal of Science from 2003-2007. At the U of I, Dr. Shreeve served as chair of the chemistry department from 1973-1987 and vice-president of research from 1987-1999. Dr. Shreeve was named a fellow of the American Chemical Society in 2010, and in 2011 was the first woman at the U of I to achieve the rank of Distinguished Professor, a role she continues in today.  </p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="1845" data-orig-width="1325"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/171668994003_1.jpg" data-orig-height="1845" data-orig-width="1325"/></figure>
