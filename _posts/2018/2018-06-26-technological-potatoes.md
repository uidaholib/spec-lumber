“Should you or should you not buy a personal computer for use in the management of your farming operation?... It depends on you as a person and on the nature of your agricultural enterprise. If you are already a good manager, the computer can make you better. If your management practices and your decision making are somewhat suspect, it is unlikely that adding the complication of a computer to your operation is going to help.”
