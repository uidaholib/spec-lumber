In addition to silver, zinc and lead, copper also became a primary ore mined in the Coeur dâ€™Alene Mining region. Incorporated in 1906, the National Copper Mining Company consisted of 8 mining claims and one mill site, shown here 5 years after its first demise after steadily declining production. National Copper held on with renewed stock options following a purchase of nearby developments in the 1920s, however, until the final dissolution of the corporation in 1943.
