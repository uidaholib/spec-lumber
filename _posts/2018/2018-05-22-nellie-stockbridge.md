Nellie Stockbridge was a pioneering photographer.

In 1898, Stockbridge arrived in the north Idaho mining town
of Wallace, Idaho from central Illinois to work in the photography studio of
T.N. Barnard. By 1907, Nellie had purchased a quarter share of the business and
would eventually take over the studio. She spent six decades
creating a visual record of the Wallace area by capturing every day moments as
well as documenting the work of the mines that fueled the areaâ€™s economy and
disasters which impacted the region such as the Big Burn fire of 1910.
