The Vandal Flying Club offered students and community members an opportunity to learn
the art of flying inexpensively. According to the Gem of the Mountains yearbook, the organization was started in 1949. It was created with the purpose of helping licensed pilots with the cost of
flying and to teach more people to fly while developing
a greater interest in aviation. The group purchased its own plane that was used for flying lessons!
