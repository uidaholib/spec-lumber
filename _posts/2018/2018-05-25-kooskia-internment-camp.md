May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. In observance, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives shares photos from its photography collection featuring a hand-made scrapbook documenting some aspects of life in the Kooskia, Idaho Internment Camp where Japanese American men were forced to live during World War II between the years 1943-1945. The Kooskia camp was unique in that its inmates volunteered to transfer there from other camps and received wages for their work.

A total of some 265 detainees occupied the Kooskia Internment Camp at various times between May 1943 and May 1945. Although some internees held camp jobs, most worked construction on a portion of the Lewis and Clark Highway (now US 12) between Lewiston, Idaho,and Missoula, Montana.
