The World Health Organization observes World Blood Donor Day
June 14 to raise awareness of the importance of blood donation. The University
of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives notes the strong history of
faculty, staff and student participation in blood drives and blood donation on
the University of Idaho campus. According to UI student newspaper The Argonaut
the UI gained the reputation as the “bloodiest campus in the world” during
World War II when Idaho led all colleges in the percentage of blood donated.
During a 1963 drive the campus community turned out in large numbers again requiring
a waiting area for willing donors.

The 1962 and 1963
blood drives continued the University of Idaho’s tradition of strong support
for blood donation with 801 pints and 903 pints donated, respectively, a number
far above the quota of 750 pints set for each of the two years.
