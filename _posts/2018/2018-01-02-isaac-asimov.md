Happy Birthday to the late great Isaac Asimov, born January 2nd, 1920. We have many works created by or related to him in our new science fiction collection, including a large assortment of Isaac Asimovâ€™s Science Fiction Magazine. In 1977 he lent his name to the magazine and wrote material up until his death in 1992.
