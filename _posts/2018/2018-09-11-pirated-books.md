These “pirated” editions of *The Lord of the Rings* were published in the US in 1965 by Ace Books. When JRR Tolkien refused to let Donald Wollheim of Ace Books publish paperback editions of *The Lord of the Rings*, Wollheim found what he considered a loophole in copyright law to let him publish these. These editions brought much controversy with Tolkien urging his fans to purchase the authorized versions, published by Ballantine Books.
