Todayâ€™s [Archives Outdoors](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/archivesoutdoors.html) shows a group of University of Idaho College of Mines students, presumably on a field trip. Incidentally, one of our metadata listings for this image states they are at an exhibit, while another states they are at an adit, which according to Wikipedia is "(from Latin aditus, entrance) an entrance to an underground mine which is horizontal or nearly horizontal, by which the mine can be entered, drained of water, ventilated, and minerals extracted at the lowest convenient level. Adits are also used to explore for mineral veins." Perhaps this adit is no longer a working mine, but just used for display?
