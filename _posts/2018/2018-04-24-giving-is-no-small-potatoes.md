Today at noon begins University of Idahoâ€™s Vandal Giving Day! Every [donation](https://vandalsgive.uidaho.edu/giving-day/4826) is just as exciting as these Idaho Potatoes being delivered to President George H.W. Bush and First Lady Barbara! #VandalsGive Above, Idaho Governor Cecil D. Andrus personally inspects the Idaho spuds to be shipped direct to the White House. Mrs. Bush requested the delivery of Idaho potatoes after a conversation with Governor Andrus at a dinner party. Below: Bill Hartz, Idaho field merchandiser, poses in front of the White House with said special delivery.
