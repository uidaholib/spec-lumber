With a theme of *Idaho Remembers* in honor of the 100th anniversary of the end of World
War I, the state of Idaho is marking Idaho Day today with activities and events
at the Idaho Statehouse in Boise. University of Idaho Library Special Collections
and Archives joins the celebration featuring Memorial Gymnasium on the UI
campus. Opened in 1928, this historic structure honors university students and
state residents who gave their lives in service of their country during World
War I. This picture depicts the gymnasium in 1930.
