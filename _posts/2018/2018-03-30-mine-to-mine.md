University of Idaho Special Collections and Archives is starting a new Tumblr series that will be highlighting our historic mining collections.

The late Henry L. Day of Wallace, Idaho, donated the records of Day Mines, Inc. and its predecessor companies to the University of Idaho in the early 1980s. The Day Mines collection is organized into seventy-three manuscript groups and includes the records of over eighty corporations or mining partnerships acquired by, merged with, or established by the Day family, or in which the Days at some time held a dominant interest.

This series will highlight mines alphabetically, starting with A!
