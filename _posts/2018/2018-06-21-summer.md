Happy First Day of Summer from the University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives! Throughout our region and state, the start of summer signals the beginning of annual road maintenance and construction.In the mid to late 1930′s, workers for the Idaho Civilian Conservation Corps performed similar duties as members of road construction crews.

Creating roads where none had existed required not only back breaking physical labor but the use of explosive as well.

And the result could often look like this road along the Salmon River

Here’s hoping your summer brings lots of sunshine and not too many road delays!
