Lynn joined the Library in 1974, quickly making her way up to Head of Serials in 1976, one of the few women in university leadership roles at that time. Lynn became Dean in 2007, and throughout all her awards and accomplishments, her tireless efforts to improve the Library turned the building today into the heart of campus with a welcoming culture of innovation and leadership.
