Located about 3 miles north of Wallace, ID, Dayrock Mining Company became one of the main producers of lead and silver for the Day interests. 

Originally incorporated as the Stratton Mines Company in 1923, the 

Days and their associates were the major stockholders from the start, owning over a third of the outstanding shares. Frequent board membership changes up through 1928 eventually saw the original namesake become a business rival. </p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="2193" data-orig-width="1777"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/173011233308_1.jpg" data-orig-height="2193" data-orig-width="1777"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="2241" data-orig-width="1769"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/173011233308_2.jpg" data-orig-height="2241" data-orig-width="1769"/></figure><blockquote class="bg-light pt-1 px-4 font-italic"><p>MG 272_2-29, discovery photos, party: Fred Merriam(?), James A.
