Just a few more hours of Vandal Giving Day! #VandalsGive Donations to the [Library](https://vandalsgive.uidaho.edu/giving-day/4826) are vital for us to continue the opportunity to grow, explore, and truly commit to our vision of building a world-class research library for our university community. Here, the Potlatch Corporation business papers are loaded up and headed to the U of I Library with the help of Keith Petersen, Bob Hook, Paul Tobin, and Richard Beck. Special Collectionsâ€™ Potlatch collections are among our most widely used collections. Thank you for your support!
