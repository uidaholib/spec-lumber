University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives congratulates the 578 Vandals receiving degrees during Fall commencement ceremonies today in the ASUI Kibbie Activity Center. Ceremonies past, like one pictured here in 1961, saw graduates don their regalia and process into Memorial Gymnasium for the ceremony.

Anyone unable to attend may watch the [proceedings online](https://www.uidaho.edu/news/ui-live).
