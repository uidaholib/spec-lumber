The Empire Copper Company, located near the city of Mackay in central Idaho, was at one time the largest producer of copper in the state of Idaho. At the height of its production it consisted of 38 mining claims, a smelter capable of handling over 500 tons of ore daily, and a 7 ¾ mile Shay railroad connecting the mines and smelter. Beginning in 1884, the mine was originally known as the White Knob Mining Company, but changed names, locations of incorporation, and management throughout its working life. Fluctuation in copper prices also affected the mines’ ability to do business, and frequently would fall into receivership or even close. 

From just a brief glance into the boxes, there were mentions of a "Princess" with no other explanation than the two pieces of correspondence above, an inquiry into scrap metal, and reports from a Globe Inspection Company operative describing possible I.W.W. infiltrators.
