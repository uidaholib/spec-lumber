Stratton was elected chairman/president and Mr. William J. Stratton secretary. Presumably they make up the company Stratton and Stratton said to hold the original mining interest that became the Option, and in whose office the first meeting of stockholders took place. Were they husband and wife? Brother and sister-in-law? Mother and son? Yet another unknown mystery and potential research project. </p><blockquote class="bg-light pt-1 px-4 font-italic"><p>MG 274_1-1, Minutes book and bylaws, 1925. </p></blockquote>
