 <p>With Banned Book Week fast approaching, our Reading Room has gotten a new exhibit featuring banned and challenged books from our collections. We thought we would put some of our favorites out for everyone to see. (Books from the Victoria E. Mitchell and Jon Gustafson Collection on Science Fiction and the Stonewall Collection)</p>
