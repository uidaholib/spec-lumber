 <p>Welcome back to #FunnyFriday ! This letter written by a young boy, George, to his Grandpa, with the help of his Mother, Inga, caught our attention when George asks&nbsp;“Did you have a nice trip to Moscow? We are hoping you won’t do anything really bad so you’ll have to wear hand-cuffs again.”&nbsp;(MG 39, Anton Hanson Family Papers.)</p>
