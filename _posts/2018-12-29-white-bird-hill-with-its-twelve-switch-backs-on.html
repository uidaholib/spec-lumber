 <p>White Bird Hill, with its twelve switch backs on U.S. 95, is a scenic wonder. It rises more than 3000 ft. in 11 miles to the Camas Prairie on a 5% grade. In springtime the hillsides are abloom in wildflowers. Being the geographical center of Idaho, anyone traveling from one edge of the state to the other, north and south, must traverse this spiraling roadway. (PG107_089, c. 1960)</p>
