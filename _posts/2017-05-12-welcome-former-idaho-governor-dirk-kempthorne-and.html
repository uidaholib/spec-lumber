 <p>Welcome former Idaho Governor Dirk Kempthorne and wife Patricia to the UI Library! This morning’s tour included a stop at the MILL (Making, Innovating, Learning Laboratory) and at the Special Collections and Archives display of materials showcasing his considerable career in Idaho and U.S. politics. At tomorrow’s commencement ceremony, Kempthorne will be honored with a doctorate in administrative science. Congratulations!</p>
