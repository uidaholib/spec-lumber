Print versions of a potato caricature had existed since 1952. Mr. Idaho Potato, standing here next to his friend Minnie Mouse, was designed and created by Linda Harper, a New York artist 

with Dudley Anderson and Yutzy, hired to do design work as part of a national public relations program for the Idaho Potato Commission. </p><blockquote><p>Idaho Potato Commission Report, 1983, no. 2, page 3. </p></blockquote>
