<p>What were people reading during the holidays in 1916? University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives thinks <i>The Romance
of a Christmas Card</i>, published that year, is one possibility. The copy of this title included in our book collections was written by Katie Douglas Smith Wiggin, educator and
author of the children’s classic <i>Rebecca
of Sunnybrook Farm. </i>The story tells the tale of two separate Christmas
cards written by a vicar’s wife and the impact each card has in the
life of the recipient.  <br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="3407" data-orig-width="2239"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/168336317248_0.jpg" data-orig-height="3407" data-orig-width="2239"/></figure><p>If you can’t make it into the Special Collections Reading
