According to the 

Athletics section of the first General Catalog, published for the 1893-1894 academic year: “Little attention was given during the year to college sports. During the spring term a football team was organized and some interesting games were played. Under the auspices of the football team Field Day sports were held June 9.</p><p>The affair was impromptu. Though the men had had little training, each event upon the programme was well sustained, much to the surprise and delight of a large number of spectators. Some very effective work was done, promising much for athletics in the future.”</p><p>Perhaps this was indeed our first football team.</p><blockquote><p>MG 28, Clara Ransom Davis papers, 1883-1957.
