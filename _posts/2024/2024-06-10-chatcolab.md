For the 75th summer in a row, a group of enthusiastic lifelong learners from around the Northwest will gather on Lake Chatcolet for a week of leadership training set in one of northern Idaho's most beautiful recreation settings.

Chatcolab, an annual summer event, draws its name from both the lake it originally called home and the experiential nature of its programming. Folks from Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Montana are drawn to Chatcolab for programs that foreground practical leadership training, build collaborative skills and welcome each participant to share their own expertise with fellow "labbers." 

The model followed by Chatcolab draws inspiration from other adult education projects of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Chautauquas, developed in a New York town of the same name, were popular forms of entertainment and enrichment in rural America at the turn of the 20th century. Short presentations covering myriad disciplines, from music to progressive ideals, drew in diverse audiences.

Another influence on Chatcolab creators was the philanthropist J.R. Crouse's Hartland Area Project of the 1930s. The mission of that group was "to bring the privilege of music, drama, handicrafts, library service, health and welfare work" to the rural residents of that Michigan community. 

Finally, one of the founders of Chatcolab, Don Clayton, attended the 1948 Black Hills Recreation Leadership Laboratory. Clayton, a Presbyterian minister in Moscow, saw great potential in such programming and was compelled to bring a similar event to the Inland Empire. Rec Labs, as they were known, gave individuals employed in recreational leadership roles a chance to share ideas and methods in hands-on settings rather than in a traditional classroom.

From the start, Chatcolab has been focused on bringing interested and open-minded people together for a week of learning that is both practical and fun. 

"If you have an interest in people and their pastimes, CHAT holds a lot for you," the 1958 program handout read. "No matter what your walk or station in life, you (the person) are what's important at CHATCOLAB. You need CHAT; CHAT needs you. So plan to come." 
CHAT became an acronym in the group for "College of Hidden Arts and Talents," and the course offerings were filled with examples of individual interests shared generously. Attendees in 1958 could look forward to learning about leather working, philosophy, fly tying, party planning and lapidary, among many other specialties.

Over the years, Chatcolab moved to various locations in Idaho. Each spot was chosen for its camp-like setting, which fostered communal work like group meal preparations. No matter the setting, Chatcolab's dedicated volunteer board felt that "a balanced mix of recreational professionals, academic experts, support staff, and youth volunteers always makes for the best lab and stimulating interaction." 
It also upheld a consistent mission, or something they call The Spirit of Chatcolab. That shared set of expectations values egalitarianism, organizational independence, multidisciplinary learning and cooperation. The professional development offered at Chatcolab has benefitted volunteers and staff from many organizations, including 4-H, Girl Scouts, parks and recreation departments, and more.

This year Chatcolab is celebrating its 75th anniversary from June 15-20. Anyone with an interest in learning more about the organization or this month's program should visit https://chatcolab.org/.
