135 years ago on January 30, 1889, Governor Stevenson of the Idaho Territory signed the bill that established the University of Idaho. Idaho itself was a year away from statehood and its land-grant university was the only university in Idaho for 71 years until 1963.

The original administration building was built in 1892. Construction was ongoing when early scholars took classes in rooms that didn't have desks. Students sat on boxes, the floor, and windowsills. It was nearly ten years before the building was finished. It stood as the University's primary building until it was destroyed by fire in 1906.

A second administration building was constructed on the site of the original and is the one we are familiar with today. It continues to anchor the university to its past as the University of Idaho educates students to create our future.
