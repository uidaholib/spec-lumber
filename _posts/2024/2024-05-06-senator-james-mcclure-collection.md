One of the largest single collections in the University of Idaho Library’s Special Collections and Archives is the James A. McClure papers. The documents relate to McClure’s distinguished career as a politician, beginning with three terms in the Idaho House of Representatives, followed by six years representing Idaho in the U.S. House, and coming to a close in 1990 after eighteen years as a U.S. Senator. Filling more than 700 banker-sized boxes, the collection preserves all manner of primary sources related to Senator McClure’s work, from speeches and correspondences with constituents, to campaign materials and newspaper clippings. For anyone with an interest in modern American politics or Idaho’s history over the last half-century, the McClure papers offer a distinct window into the past. While the collection is too vast to catalog here, below are a few interesting highlights to inspire your curiosity.

As a young politician, McClure represented Payette County in the Idaho State Senate. The saying goes that all politics are local, but that must have been especially true for the senator. He grew up in Payette and was serving as the county’s prosecuting attorney while also holding his legislative office. His constituents knew him and were not shy about sharing their thoughts. His archival papers include countless letters from voters, asking him to act in one fashion or another. Mrs. Elizabeth Brooks did not mince words when she implored Senator McClure to support schools with additional sales taxes. Just as he did with dozens of other letter writers, he replied directly to thank her for her interest and share his perspective on the matter.

McClure and his staff kept impressive records of his positions on legislative matters, carefully documenting why and how he arrived at each “Yae” or “Nay” vote. For example, in 1970 McClure was serving in the U.S. House of Representatives and considering the farm bill, which had major implications for producers in his home state. The file on H.R. 18546 is filled with memos addressed to McClure, like the one sent by the chair and vice chair of the Committee on Agriculture. The note across the bottom reads, “the basic logic expressed here is very bad, the argument on payment limitations is quite good.” Another communication sent by the representative from Hawaii asked for the rejection of an amendment that would hurt his state’s sugar cane growers. On it, McClure emphatically noted “of course I support it, or the beet industry would die.”

Senator McClure served on and then chaired the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for many years. He became an enthusiastic proponent of eclectic cars years before they were widely considered practical by average Americans. In 1977 he coordinated an electric vehicle demonstration for his fellow lawmakers during which he gladly posed for pictures with XDH-1 experimental vehicle produced by Sears, Roebuck and Company. His affinity for the technology was even included in his New York Times obituary from 2011, which noted that his personal car was electric. Within the McClure papers here at the university, electric cars are mentioned in the finding aid nearly 30 times.
