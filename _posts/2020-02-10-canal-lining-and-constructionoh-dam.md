This week, we’re discussing canal lining and
construction. Building a canal for a dam is extremely important because canals
must be able to “withstand enormous water pressure,” must be “watertight so
that they will not leak,” and must “be able to offer protection from the risk
of erosion caused by the flowing water.”[^1]

Building a canal consists of levelling and compacting the
bottom of the canal, or lining it. “A filter layer consisting of sand and
gravel is then put in place and, on top of that, a sealing layer of fine soil,
cement or asphalt.”[^1]
