Commonly known as &ldquo;Mem Gym&rdquo;, the Memorial
Gymnasium was built in 1929 as a memorial to all Idahoans who lost their lives
in World War 1. The building was
designed by UI faculty members David C. Lang, University Architect and head of
the Department of Architecture, and Theodore Pritchard, Assistant Professor of
Art. It features many architectural quirks such as the
leatherhead-footballer gargoyles that decorate its walls and windows. 

Extensive renovation was completed in 1954. It has
served as a sports arena and physical education venue seating 2,500 as well as
for UI commencements and other events. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt gave a
lecture in the main gymnasium in 1938, which is one of many reasons that the
building was added to the National Register of Historic Places at the
relatively young age of 49 years in 1977. <br/></p><blockquote><p>PG 1-61-40; today photo by UI Library Special Collections staff; <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/campus/locations/MemorialGymnasium.html#more">Campus Photograph Collection</a></p></blockquote>
