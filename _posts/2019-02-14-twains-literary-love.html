<p>To celebrate love and romance, today we will be making posts about the different kinds of love found in our collections. Starting with the literary love letters of Mark Twain. </p><figure data-orig-width="1819" data-orig-height="2774" class="tmblr-full mb-5"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/182809681923_0.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1819" data-orig-height="2774"/></figure><p>This compilation of letters from Samuel L. Clemens (Twain) to his wife Olivia Langdon documents their relationship through their courtship, engagement, and marriage. </p><p>On March 6, 1869 he writes sweetly to his betrothed “&hellip;as the dew loves the flowers; as the birds love the sunshine; as the wavelets love the breeze; as mothers love their first-born; as memory loves old faces; as the yearning tides love the moon; as the angels love the pure in heart.”</p><p>Continuing to write about his life, such as who he has and has not visited, how “perfectly awful” it is when his sister spells John with a G, how he doesn’t mind when his love misspells, and reflecting on receiving and responding to letters from her, he closes “<i>Yours, </i>forever &amp; always, Sam”</p><p>The best part of this letter, however, comes when he critiques his own writing and asks Livy to burn it. </p><p>“P.S. I have read this letter over &amp; it is flippant, &amp; foolish, &amp; puppyish. I wish I had gone to bed when I got back, without writing. You said I must never tear up a letter after writing it to you &ndash;&amp; so I send it. Burn it Livy&ndash;I did not think I was writing so clownishly &amp; shabbily. I was in much too good a humor for sensible letter writing.” (Mark Twain Collection)<br/></p>
