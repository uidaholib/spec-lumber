With most interaction happening through email, through phone calls, or even video-conferencing, we wanted to remind everyone of the lovely postcard and letter. During these trying times, the smallest bit of happiness is valuable, and who isn’t happy to received an unexpected message from a friend in their mailbox? </p><p>Since we don’t have your address, we thought we’d send a postcard message to you from here: </p><p>“Dear Friend, <br/><br/>We hope this card finds you well. The past several weeks have been trying and a bit stressful, but all in all we are doing all right. It appears that spring and summer are just around the bend, so when we saw this card we just had to share it. Do you have any plans for the summer? Do you hope to visit a lake? We hope to be able to go out and enjoy Idaho’s wonderful nature to its full extent as soon as possible with our friends and family. </p><p>Though we are not sure exactly when that will be possible, we hope the coming months are brighter than the last. Stay happy and healthy to the best of your ability and we are thinking of when we can spend time with you again. </p><p>Kindest Thoughts, </p><p>UI Spec Staff”</p><p>Postcard courtesy of the Northwest Historical Postcards Collection</p>
