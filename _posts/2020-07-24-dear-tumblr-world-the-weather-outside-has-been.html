 <p>Dear Tumblr World,&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The weather outside has been just wonderful, warm and sunny days. When I canâ€™t spend this time with all my friends, it makes me want to go for a nice hike in the splendid nature of North Idaho. I might even end it with a cool swim in Lake Pend Oreille. How are you spending your summer days?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Cheers!</p>
