In 1946, amid the post-war boom of veterans going to college and the accompanying increase in people and vehicle traffic, the University of Idaho decided a security officer was needed. Fred Pennell was selected to handle most police work on campus and eight years later, he became the University's traffic officer. 

Affectionately known as "Freddy the Cop," he hailed by the Argonaut as the UI's first and only traffic officer. "It's a nice job and a nice bunch of people to work with," he remarked (Argonaut, Jan 19, 1965). He was also active in the University community. He was a "policeman, unofficial public relations man, amateur student adviser and part-time greeter...." (Argonaut, Apr 22, 1966).

A well-known presence on campus, invited to house dinners. Home Management had him over for dinner. HM is a house students and an advisor lived in to study the practical application of home making principles.

Fred was ankle deep in running watcher directing cars at the Campus Christen Center intersection.

He once appeared in an Argonaut April Fool's spoof articles: He was also mentioned in the student paper when his absence from campus was note in 1965.

"Freddy ... was afraid of the dark and his only weapon consisted of a Civil War service revolver...." 

An illness had confined him to Gritman Memorial Hospital for a few days, but he soon returned (Argonaut, Jan 19, 1965). When his retirement was announced, the Argonaut described him as a "University Legend" (Argonaut Apr 22, 1966).

Originally from Tennessee, Pennell had been a Whitman County farmer in Washington and a student at Washington State College (now Washington State University). He patrolled the Idaho campus for nineteen years and was hailed by the Argonaut as the UI's first and only traffic officer. In 1966, he remarked, "A nice class of people to work with, something new all the time, and you meet people from all over the world, some of them very distinguished."
