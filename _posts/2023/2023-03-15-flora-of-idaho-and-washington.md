A new collection has just been processed and turned into a digital collection. Introducing: [Flora of Idaho and Washington](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/flora/)!

This collection contains photographs taken by Thomas R. Ashlee, U of I Florist, and Geoffrey Coope, U of I Professor of English. In the early 1930s, Coope and Ashlee traveled around Latah County and parts of Washington to document the different plant species of the area.

Some of the images in this collection were used in an educational display of local botany sponsored by Ashlee and Coope in 1933. The exhibit featured large glass photographic plates showcasing the flora of Latah County and greater North Idaho. It was displayed at the University of Idaho Library as a way to increase student interaction.
