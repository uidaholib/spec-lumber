The University of Idaho Golf Course boasts a rich history and a legacy of traditions. Over the years, it has welcomed esteemed players like Byron Nelson and Harold (Jug) McSpaden. In fact, in August 1946, these exceptional golfers triumphed over Roy Moe and Neil Christian of Spokane with a 4-up victory in an exhibition best ball match held at the University of Idaho Golf Course.
 
The inaugural golf course on our campus was established as early as 1936, initially comprising nine holes.

The increasing popularity of golf among Idaho students was noted by the Argonaut in 1928. The growing number of enthusiasts for this sport has led to a noticeable occurrence of golf balls being hit all over the campus grounds. To address this issue, the students expressed their desire for a more appropriate location. In 1930, they took the initiative to develop a course themselves during a campus work day, which was later completed by university workmen the following year. However, this course proved to be insufficient, prompting the school to purchase a total of seventy acres adjacent to the campus in the southwest area of the arboretum. An additional thirty acres were also acquired, and the school made plans to construct the finest golf course in the state in 1935.
