In 2012, [Kristin C. Becker](http://kristincarlsonbecker.com/about.html) worked with the first grade class of Palouse Prairie School of Expeditionary Learning to create drawings based on the downtown structures of Moscow, Idaho. This project taught valuable skills, but it also instilled a sense of understanding about the Moscow community and its history. Inspired by the project, Kristin went on to create her own prints of downtown. In June 2013, these prints - along with the drawings done by the first graders - were showcased in the City of Moscow's Art Walk.

Below are silkscreen prints by Kristin C. Becker of downtown Moscow, which can be found in the newly processed [Kristin C. Becker silkscreen prints](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv158039) collection.
