*“A good snapshot keeps a moment from running away.”
            ― Eudora Welty*

Photographers have documented the University of Idaho campus and events for most of its existence. They take pictures of groups like U of I Marching Band, clubs and fraternities. These visual journalists also cover events on and off the Moscow campus like class registration, Moscow Mardi Gras, rodeos, sporting events, parades, and graduations. While all the photographs are well done, some are pieces of art, capturing the beauty of our campus.

This collection of images is from two Photo Center collections in the Library's Special Collections & Archives. They range from the late 1970s to the early 1980s.
