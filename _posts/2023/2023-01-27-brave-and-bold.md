This exhibit continues the celebration of the U of I Women Center’s 50th anniversary as well as Title IX’s anniversary. It's purpose is to showcase some of the women who have left their mark on the University. Some of these outstanding women have been honored with building dedications, colleges, and scholarships. This exhibit offers a starting point to explore women’s diverse experiences at the University of Idaho. This post will briefly touch on three women included in the display.

In 1899, Jennie Hughes was the first African American student to graduate from the university. In a winning oration, she said: *“Few of us may hope to become what the world calls great; our words and deeds may not direct the affairs of state, … but our influence may be felt.”*

Jean Collette became head of dramatics in 1933. It was a position she would hold at the university for 30 years, having an impact on the theatre arts program that is still seen today. After her passing in 1976, a contemporary remarked, *“Someone once said, ‘To teach is to inspire.’ Ah, yes! There you have it! And that was Jean Collette. And yes, she did inspire me…”*

And finally, Elisabeth Zinser was the university’s 14th president and the first woman to serve. At the ceremony inaugurating her into the position she said, *“Only when we embrace our diversity, indeed celebrate it, will all our cultures and all our regions unite to make one Idaho as strong as it can be.”*
