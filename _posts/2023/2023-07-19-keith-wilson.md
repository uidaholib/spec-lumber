Keith served in the 71st Infantry Division and saw combat in Germany and Austria. It was in Austria that the division liberated Gunskirchen Lager, a concentration camp constructed near the end of 1944. Most prisoners in this death camp were Jews from Hungary. About 1,500 people had died before the division came, and Keith was present during it.

After being honorable discharged from the military, Keith took over the family farm. He died on June 19, 2017 in Spokane, Washington. In 2023, Carol Kauppila, Wilson's niece, started an endowment fund in his name at the University of Idaho and donated some of his materials to the archives. These materials included photographs, service pins, and medals - two of which are Bronze Stars.
