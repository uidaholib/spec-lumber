Post written by Dusty Fleener, 2022 Gary E. and Carolyn J. Strong Fellow in Special Collections and Archives. 

In working with fandom-related topics, one may learn new terms and often it helps ot have a cheat sheet or glossary. Internet access and a good Google search in the 21st century can demystify these in moments whereas in the past one had to have a fen friend serve as translator for the mundane or become part of the circles where such were spoken. For convenience in what one might find in the collection when visiting the University of Idaho:



The man who donated these materials to help reserve PESFA and MosCon for future fandom history, Michael Finkbiner, has been involved in Canadian and American fandom since the 1970s. He has been recognized as a fan guest of honor twice (V-Con 14 and MisCon 2), and still attends fan conventions today. 



One of the highlights for me working with the collection was learning more about the award that the Palouse Empire Science Fiction Association awarded through MosCon to its guests of honor. A great moment of excitement came in the last box of items in the collection - ballots returned to the convention committee for awarding of the Second Stage Lensman award. Among the many professional artists and writers in the science fiction and fantasy community of creators, Isaac Asimov's ballot and signature stood out. 



While there was no Second-Stage Lensman Award in the material donated by Mike Finkbiner to the University of Idaho's Special Collections and Archives, he did bring one from his collection ot the talk he gave at the 2019 MosCon Revival as an example of what was given by the convention committee. 



The collection also contains a complete collection of APA-Loosa (later changed to Apaloosa), the PESFA Amateur Press Association, shepherded by Chris Nilsson. 

Why does all this matter? Science fiction and fantasy fandom have evolved from the 1970s and into the 2010s bringing it into mainstream culture. Helping to make these materials available to researchers and the public, fan historians can begin filling in resources like the [Fancyclopedia 3](https://fancyclopedia.org/Fancyclopedia_3), which evolved from Jack Speer's Fancyclopedia and Dick Eney's Fancyclopedia 2, to bring more of PESFA's contributions into the narrative of Pacific Northwest fandom culture.

And if we tell great stories, great things will come. 

Thanks to the generous donations of Gary E. and Carolyn J. Strong I was able to assist in getting this collection transferred into archival folders and boxes, build a finding aid, and learn from primary source material about the Palouse Empire Science Fiction Association (PESFA) and its members.
