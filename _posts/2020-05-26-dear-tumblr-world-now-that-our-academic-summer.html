 <p>Dear Tumblr World,</p>
 <p>Now that our academic summer has begun, the weather is getting nicer and the flowers are blooming. We hope you are able to take a break from working from home to get outside and enjoy the nature in your neighborhood. Or if you are part of the brave few that are called to the essential tasks of keeping civilization running, we hope you are able to find joy in your day.</p>
 <p>Best,</p>
