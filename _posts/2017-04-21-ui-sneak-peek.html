You and your family can experience our beautiful campus and get a preview of what it’s like to be a student here. There are guided tours of campus, residence halls, and fraternities and sororities as well as information sessions on activities and opportunities, such as study abroad, honors and career tools among others. You can also meet with UI representatives for information on how to apply for admission, the financial aid process and much more.

</p><p>Be sure to stop by the Library and especially the Special Collections Reading Room to see our newly remodeled first floor and some fun historical materials! We have tours from 1:00 - 1:45 pm and 2:00 - 2:45 pm today. Hope to see you there!</p><blockquote><p>PG 101-2379, Students at information
