Summer is officially underway here at the University of Idaho. If you need inspiration to visit the great state of Idaho, here are some historical guides highlighting fun facts and notable destinations throughout the state. One common theme throughout the early guides is how beneficial the climate is to the health of all residents, some even point out based on mortality rates that Idaho is the healthiest state in the nation. All the guides also agree that Idaho doesn't lack for precious gems and lucrative ores ready to be mined or timber to be harvested. For more in depth research, these resources can all be found in the U of I Library Special Collections.
