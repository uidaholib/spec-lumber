 <p>A boy, a lamb, and a puppy at the 1936 Little International agricultural show and contest. The first Little International was in 1923, and is still being held by University of Idahoâ€™s Block and Bridle Club. A highlight of early shows was a parade of musicians, floats and of course livestock from campus to downtown Moscow, ID.</p>
