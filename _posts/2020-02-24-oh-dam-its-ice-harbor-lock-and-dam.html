<p>Welcome back to another week of Oh Dam!, our mini-series
on dams in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Today we’re discussing Ice Harbor Lock and Dam located on
the Snake River “upstream of McNary Lock and Dam and Lake Wullala.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>The project was enabled by the River and Harbor Act of
1945. Construction began in t9156 and was completed in 1961. The dam creates
Lake Sacajawea, which “extends upstream about 32 miles to Lower Monumental Lock
and Dam and has a surface area of 9,200 acres.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[2]</a></p><figure data-orig-width="2833" data-orig-height="2268" class="tmblr-full mb-5"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/191001492339_0.jpg" data-orig-width="2833" data-orig-height="2268"/></figure><p>The navigation lock is a “single-lift lock, 86 feet wide
by 675 feet long, with a 100 foot vertical lift. In 2015, traffic through the
navigation lock consisted of grains, petroleum products, fertilizer, wood
products, and miscellaneous cargo that amounted to more 2.3 million tons.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[3]</a></p><p>
















The
dam was built with two fish ladders but “in 2005, a spillway weir was also
installed to improve passage conditions for juvenile salmon downstream out
migration. Because of significant declines in Pacific Lamprey through its range
during the past three decades, in 2009, modifications were made to one Ice
Harbor fish ladder to improve adult lamprey passage. Those modifications
included a lamprey fish ladder entrance weir, lamprey passage structures,
ladder improvements and installation of metal plating to assist lamprey
upstream.”[4]<br/></p><p>
