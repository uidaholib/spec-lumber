 <p>Miniature photos of Moscow and the University of Idaho, published by Pacific Photo Co., circa 1918.&nbsp; I thought it was interesting that these photos appear to be postcards that were cut up.&nbsp; They all measure 1.75 by 2.75 inches.&nbsp; They are from Historical Photograph Collection 35: Idaho Scenes.&nbsp; The photos are in no particular order, the metadata we have for the images is as follows: <br></p>
 <p>35-20a No 64, Engineering building. University of Idaho. &nbsp;<br>35-20b No 79, Agricultural building. [Official name: Morrill Hall, 1906- ]. University of Idaho. <br>35-20c No 71, Gymnasium. University of Idaho. &nbsp;<br>35-20d No 10, Moscow Hotel and I.O.O.F. Block. Moscow, Idaho. &nbsp;<br>35-20e No 41, View from School of Mines, Moscow, Idaho. &nbsp;<br>35-20f No 46, Administration Building. Moscow, Idaho. &nbsp;<br>35-20g Scene of East City Park.
