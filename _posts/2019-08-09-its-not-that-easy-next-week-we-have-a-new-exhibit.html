 <p><b>It’s Not That Easy</b></p>
 <p>Next week we have a new exhibit opening. So, this week we have been staging the exhibit, prepping the cases, cleaning the cases, and hanging part of the exhibit. It’s a lot of work, but is starting to come together. This afternoon we begin install, followed closely by a nap. Exhibits work is exhausting…but worth it!</p>
 <p>We will see you next week with the final install pictures!</p>
