 <p>Sheep in a corral, from the Edward John Iddings Lantern Slide Collection, a collection of&nbsp;images from an international trip by Dean of the College of Agriculture E.J. Iddings and his wife Maude Rowell in 1927. Iddings took a sabbatical leave from June to December to study agricultural practices abroad. He visited Great Britain and overseas dominions of the British Empire, including New Zealand, Australia, India, Ceylon, and Egypt. Other European countries in the tour included Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, France, and Italy. The images depict agricultural practices in the countries they visited, along with scenes of the cities, buildings, transportation, and people.&nbsp;</p>
