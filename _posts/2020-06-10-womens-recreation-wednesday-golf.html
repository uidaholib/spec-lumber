<p>Welcome back to another week of Women’s Recreation
Wednesday, our series covering the Women’s Recreation Association here at the
University of Idaho.</p><p>This week features photos of women playing golf. According
to some, Queen Mary of Scotland was the very first female golfer, playing while
she was queen from 1542-1567.<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>
However, “the first recorded golf tournament for women only occurred on January
9, 1811…in the town of Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland for local
fisherman’s wives of Musselburgh and Fisherrow, a neighboring town.” You can
