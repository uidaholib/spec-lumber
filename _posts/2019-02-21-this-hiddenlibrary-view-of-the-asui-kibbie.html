 <p>This #hiddenlibrary view of the ASUI-Kibbie Activity Center was taken on a snowy day kinda like today from the Library’s 4th floor mail room. The Kibbie&nbsp;“Dome” is home to numerous campus events, including the <a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/class/jazzfest">Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival</a> taking place this Friday and Saturday!&nbsp;</p>
