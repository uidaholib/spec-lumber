Although Idaho doesnâ€™t actually grow gigantic potatoes (sadly), it does produce about 13 billion pounds of potatoes each year, supplying roughly one-third of the United States potato crop! We love potatoes so much that Idaho even has a Potato Museum!</p><p>Postcard courtesy of MA2018-13 Keith Peterson Papers, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives</p>
