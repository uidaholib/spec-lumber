<p>MERRY CHRISTMAS!<br/><br/>This brightly colored Christmas card inspired a sonnet about archival ninjas:</p><p>“Archival Ninjas in the basement here.<br/>Our cardigans forever keeping warm.<br/>Our mission to protect without any fear.<br/>Historic papers left behind inform.<br/><br/>Insects have much to fear with ninjas ‘round.<br/>No ants, no spiders, silverfish can hide.<br/>If we see nibble marks, they will be found.<br/>Such pests cause damage, we cannot abide<br/><br/>We help as best we can those who visit<br/>From all around the lands to see our stuff.<br/>When they fail in their search it is implicit,<br/>Out of air we appear with no rebuff <br/><br/>To help you find unknown fun left behind<br/>With a word your search may be redefined.”<br/><br/>(Poem by Spec Staff)<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1433" data-orig-height="1724" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/189866068621_0.jpg" data-orig-width="1433" data-orig-height="1724"/></figure>
