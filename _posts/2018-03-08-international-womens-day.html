<p style="">In honor of International Women’s Day University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives recognizes the achievements of M. Belle Sweet, the library’s first professional librarian.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="477" data-orig-width="305"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/171658445108_0.jpg" data-orig-height="477" data-orig-width="305"/></figure><p>Miss Sweet was appointed head librarian in 1905 at the age
of 26. She served in her position for approximately 16 months before a
devastating fire consumed the University’s administration building and wiped
out nearly all of the Library’s 12,000 volume collection.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1044" data-orig-width="1607"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/171658445108_1.jpg" data-orig-height="1044" data-orig-width="1607"/></figure><p>Following the fire, Belle Sweet immediately began a campaign
to rebuild the Library’s contents. Borrowing a typewriter, Miss Sweet wrote 340
letters to university supporters, authors and publishers asking for donations
to help recreate the lost library. The success of Belle Sweet’s letter writing
campaign provided a foundation for a new collection for the University of Idaho
Library. Due to her efforts and the generosity of University of Idaho friends
and benefactors 1300 books were donated, 250 pamphlets were received and $1866.35
was raised. Belle Sweet served as head librarian from 1905 to 1948 under the
administrations of seven University presidents. In her 43 years as head
librarian, Belle Sweet helped to build what is now the largest library in the
state of Idaho. (Photos:Gem of the Mountains 1907, PG 1-51-24a)</p>
