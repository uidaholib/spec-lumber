Nez Perce County is home to three major rivers: the Clearwater, the Snake, and the Salmon. Traditionally, the lower portion of the Snake, as well as the Salmon and Clearwater was a territory belonging to the Nimi'ipuu people (Nez Perce Tribe). The Snake River is the largest tributary of the Columbia River, and one of the most important streams in the Pacific Northwest.

The [River History of Nez Perce County Slide Programs and Photographic Exhibit](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv583983) was a project compiled by Carole Simon-Smolinski in 1980. This included three slideshows featuring photographs of the rivers throughout Nez Perce County, Indigenous tribal members, mining operations, and other landscape images.
