 <p>Over the last few weeks, we have noticed the flowering of many beautiful spring and summer flowers. So, we thought we would start off the summer sessions with a new series. Every #floweryfriday we will be posting content related flowers from our collections (or walks around the neighborhood).&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This daffodil was photographed by Professor Richard Naskali, likely while he lived in Ohio in the 1950′s. Naskali was a botany professor at the University of Idaho from 1967 to his retirement in 2003. He was was also the first director of the University’s Arboretum and Botanical Garden, which is a favorite spot for students, faculty, staff, and community members throughout the year.&nbsp;</p>
