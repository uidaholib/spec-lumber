<p>To commemorate Banned Books Week, University of Idaho
Library Special Collections and Archives features books in our collection which
have been banned or challenged. One of the most frequently banned or challenged
books in America according to lists maintained by the American Library
Association Office of Intellectual Freedom is Mark Twain’s <i>The Adventures of</i> <i>Huckleberry
Finn.</i> Special Collections has multiple copies of <i>The Adventures of</i> <i>Huckleberry
Finn</i> included in its Mark Twain Collection. Here is an illustrator’s view
of Huckleberry Finn from the 1886 edition of the book in Special Collections</p><figure data-orig-width="2509" data-orig-height="3738" class="tmblr-full mb-5"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/165797218225_0.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2509" data-orig-height="3738"/></figure><p>Since its publication in 1884, <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> has generated controversy. The
first ban of the book occurred in Concord, Massachusetts just one month after
its release when librarians there called it “trash and suitable only for
slums.” Twain’s book has been repeatedly challenged based on its treatment of
race and the author’s language. It ranks #14 on the 100 Most Banned or Challenged
Books from 2000-2009. <i>The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn </i>has been included in a Library of Congress exhibit, <i>Books that Shaped</i> <i>America</i>, that explores books “that have had a profound effect on
American life.”</p>
