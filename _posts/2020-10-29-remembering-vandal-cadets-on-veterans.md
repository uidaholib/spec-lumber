# Remembering Vandal Cadets on Veterans Day
On this Veteranâ€™s Day we cast a thought back to the Vandal cadets who have served our country. Both the Army and Navy ROTC students were prodigious creators of newsletters, which let us hear their experiences on campus in their own words. Particularly in the early years, the publications seem to be remarkably unrestrained in their depiction of cadet life, include jokes, comics, and candid commentary. They even produced a parody of their own newletter, the Vandal Bugle, entitled the Vandal Bungle.

The ROTC program was founded in 1917 under the National Defense Act and cadets have gone on to serve with distinction ever since. Chrisman Hall is named after General E.R. Chrisman, who served as a Professor of Military Science from 1894 until 1932.
