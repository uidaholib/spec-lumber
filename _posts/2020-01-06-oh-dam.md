We’re starting a new series, Oh Dam! This series will feature photos and information about hydraulic dams in the Pacific Northwest (Idaho, Washington, and Oregon). Each week, the series will oscillate between information about a dam that exists in the PNW and information about how dams are built! We hope you’ll join us for Oh Dam!
