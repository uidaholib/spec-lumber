We’re starting a new mini-series, Oh Dam! This series will feature photos and information about various hydraulic dams in the Pacific Northwest (Idaho, Washington, and Oregon). Each week, the series will oscillate between information about a dam that exists in the PNW and information about how dams are built! We hope you’ll join us for Oh Dam!
