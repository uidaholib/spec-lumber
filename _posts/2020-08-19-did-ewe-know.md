In 1919, the University of Idaho became the first home west of the Rocky Mountains to the Suffolk breed of sheep thanks to a donation from the English Suffolk Sheep Society. The three ewes and two rams impressed breeders so much that Suffolk importation increased dramatically, and today itâ€™s one of the most common breeds of sheep in the U.S. Today, the University of Idaho Suffolk flock contains over 200 sheep.
