 <p>Harvesting potatoes in Juliaetta, Idaho. Behind the farmers is a rail tramway leading into a warehouse. Tramways were used throughout the Palouse, carrying wheat and other crops in some places over 2000 feet in elevation from the fertile croplands above to river transportation hubs on the canyon floors below. &nbsp;</p>
