In 1982, the University of Idaho was honored to have her perform at the University’s Jazz Festival. The night of her concert, there was a university basketball game, during her set she scat into one song that the Vandals had won the game. Her appearance at the University is one of pride for those who were fortunate enough to attend the concert and those who have heard about it. </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3000" data-orig-width="2000"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/184437720848_1.jpg" data-orig-height="3000" data-orig-width="2000"/></figure><p>

In our collections, we are lucky enough to hold some of Ella Fitzgerald’s belongings. Currently, a turquoise dress and a wig worn by Ella are on display in Los Angeles at the Grammy Museum for their exhibit on Motown.
