Idaho has an even longer history with the starchy tuber: here Len Zenkevitch is posed with New Sweden Idaho Potatoes in 1940. Much to our dismay, though, its a pretty safe bet that the bowl game will be played with an actual football and not a giant Idaho potato.</p><blockquote><p>PG 2-115-488; <a href="https://www.famousidahopotatobowl.com/the-bowl/history/">Idaho Famous Potato Bowl History</a></p></blockquote>
