Welcome back to another week of Women’s Recreation
Wednesday, our series covering the Women’s Recreation Association here at the
University of Idaho.

This week’s photos feature women skiing! The first ever recorded
ski jumping event was performed by a Norwegian woman named Ingrid Olavsdottir
Vestby who is said to have “soared 20 feet” in Trysil, Norway in 1862.[^1]
However, it wasn’t until 1990s when women were “first allowed to fully
participate in international jumping competitions. In 2006 regarding the
Olympics, the International Ski Federation (FIS) and the International Olympic
Committee “ruled that there was not enough technical merit among women ski
jumpers to allow them on the jumps” but quickly clarified that “the decision
had nothing to do with gender.”[^1]
“Women’s jumping were not on the schedule at the 2010 Winter Olympics in
Vancouver, but they [were] in 2014 at Sochi, Russia.”[^1]

That’s all for Women’s Recreation Wednesdays!! Stay tuned
for our next series, Wilderness Wednesdays, which will feature photos and research about National Parks, National Forests, and general conservation efforts in wilderness areas in Idaho!
