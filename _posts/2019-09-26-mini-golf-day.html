Today you can find one on our mini golf course in our Reading Room! For Master the Midterms Week the Library is hosting a novel mini-golf course! Putt your way through the U of I Library, under the graphic novels, between the movable shelves, and around the magazines. Visit the map room, where you can putt your way across the world! Take a “shelfie” as you “master” the Library of Congress organization system by putting between the books. The final hole is as challenging as returning your books on time! Enter your scorecard at the end of the course to be entered to win one of several prizes!</p><p>Location: Library</p><p>Date: Thursday, Sept. 26, 11:30 a.m.- 2:30 p.m.</p>
