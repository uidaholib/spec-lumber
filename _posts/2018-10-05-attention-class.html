<p>Happy World Teachers’ Day to all University of Idaho College of Education alumni as well as current students pursuing a degree in education.<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="459" data-orig-width="512"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/178766773143_0.jpg" data-orig-height="459" data-orig-width="512"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="456" data-orig-width="512"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/178766773143_1.jpg" data-orig-height="456" data-orig-width="512"/></figure><p>As the student teacher pictured in these photographs working with a class in the 1950′s would probably agree, as a career teaching is rewarding and fulfilling but it’s a job that’s never done!. Congratulations and thank you to all current and former educators! (PG 1-227-04, PG 1-227-05)<br/></p>
