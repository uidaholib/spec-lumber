<p>Yet another mother and child from Mary Kirkwood, we will have a throwback to our iambic pentameter sonnet and amniotic fluid haiku for this poem about pregnancy and iambic pentameter. <br/><br/>“no STRESS, no STRESS, no STRESS<br/>The contractions come<br/>Separated by the minutest minutes five. </p><p>no STRESS, no STRESS, no STRESS<br/>Time comes undone<br/>Prompted by every echoing rhythm.</p><p>no STRESS, no STRESS, no STRESS<br/>It has begun<br/>The crown of inherited infancy settled.</p><p>no STRESS, no STRESS, no STRESS<br/>Five iambs redone<br/>Replaced by two impactful infant feet.”</p><p>(Poem by Spec Staff)</p><figure data-orig-width="1637" data-orig-height="1238" class="tmblr-full"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/189921283835_0.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1637" data-orig-height="1238"/></figure>
