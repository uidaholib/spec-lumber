R. A. Lands Department</p><p><b>Date</b>: November 1, 1973</p><p><b>Subject:</b> New Sick Leave Policy</p><p><b>Sickness:</b> No excuse&hellip;we will no longer accept your doctor&rsquo;s statement as proof, as we believe that if you are able to go to the doctor, you are able to come to work.</p><p><b>Death:</b> (Other than your own) &hellip; . This is not excuse &hellip; there is nothing you can do for them, and we feel sure that someone else with a lesser position can attend to the arrangements. However, if the funeral can be held in the late afternoon, we will be glad to let you off 30 minutes early, provided that your share of the work is ahead enough to keep the business going in your absence.</p><p><b>Leave of Absence:</b> (For an operation) &hellip; we will no longer allow this practice. We wish to discourage any thoughts that you might need an operation as we believe that as long as you are an employee here you will need all of whatever you have, and you should not consider having anything removed. We hired you as you are and therefore, anything removed would certainly make you less than we bargained for.</p><p><b>Death: </b>(Your Own) &hellip; . This will be accepted an as excuse. But, we would like a two-week notice as we feel it is your duty to train someone else to do your job.</p><p><b>Signed:</b> Your warm hearted, loving employer, Uncle Sam.</p><p>Photo courtesy of Folder 2, MG 478 (<a href="https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv707396/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&amp;q=">Tom Kovalicky Papers</a>), University of Idaho Library, Special Collections &amp; Archives, Moscow, Idaho.</p>
