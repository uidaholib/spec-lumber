Field studies were conducted to study pole blight, a disease of western white pine trees, where a scientist would enable a solution consisting of either radioactive calcium or radioactive phosphorus, or both, to be absorbed by the tree, then examine the entire tree from trunk to tip of foliage with a Geiger counter to see where and how fast the radiation had traveled. </p><p>Thank you to <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mmIBy3nK-TdmHyW5tENEB3Q">@uwmarchives</a> for the inspiration behind this post with your #Terrifying Tuesday <a href="http://uwmarchives.tumblr.com/post/178668253077">post </a>on unshielded radiation. Terrifying indeed! </p><blockquote><p>University of Idaho Bulletin, Vol. 50 (yes, I did check, it is volume 50), No. 2, November 1954.</p></blockquote>
