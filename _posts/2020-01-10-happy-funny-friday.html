(Henry Ward Beecher)</li><li>If we could not laugh, we would all go insane. (Jimmy Buffet)</li><li>The best way to cheer yourself is to try to cheer somebody else up. (Mark Twain)</li><li>It is not so important to be serious as to be serious about the important things. The monkey wears a serious expression which would do credit to any great scholar. But the monkey is serious because Â he itches! (Laroff's Credo)</li><li>The trouble with political promises is that they go in one year and out the rest. (S.H. Simmons)</li><li>Humor is laughing at what you haven't got, when you ought to have it. (Langston Hughes)</li><li>I've developed a new philosophy &hellip; I only dread one day at a time. (Charlie Brown)</li><li>Just because you're miserable, doesn't mean you can't enjoy your life. (Annette Goodheart)</li><li>Humor is the great thing, the saving thing, after all. The minute it crops up all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place. (Mark Twain)</li><li>I do not want it said of our generation, as T.S. Eliot wrote, &ldquo;These were decent people, their only monument the asphalt road, and a thousand lost golf balls.&rdquo; We can do better than that. (John F. Kennedy)</li><li>At the height of laughter the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of possibilities. (Jean Houston)</li><li>If I can make you laugh with me, we will forget our differences, and long after the laughter has died down we will remember our likeness. (Russ Fischer)</li></ul><p>Photo courtesy of Folder 7, MG 478 (<a href="https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv707396/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&amp;q=">Tom Kovalicky Papers</a>), University of Idaho Library, Special Collections &amp; Archives, Moscow, Idaho.</p>
