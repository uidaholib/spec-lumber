<p>Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) was an Irish writer in the Victorian
Era of the late 19<sup>th</sup> century known for such plays as <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> and<i> An Ideal Husband </i>and the novel <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray.</i> University
of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives has a 1907 copy of  Wilde’s play <i>Salomé</i>.  Based on a biblical
tale, it was first written by Wilde in French in 1891 then translated to
English in 1893. The illustration of Salomé shown here is opposite the title
page in the 1907 work in Special Collections.</p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="887" data-orig-width="706"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/166608901509_0.jpg" data-orig-height="887" data-orig-width="706"/></figure><p>Wilde’s play is infamous for his stage direction which is
the first known reference to the dance Salomé is said to have performed for
Herod II as the Dance of the Seven Veils. The performance of the dance is said
to have lead to the execution of John the Baptist. Salomé is said to have
agreed to perform for Herod only if he brought her the head of John the Baptist
on a platter. In addition to his play and novel writing, Wilde was also known
for his poetry, fairy tales, and numerous journal essays. </p>
