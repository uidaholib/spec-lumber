 <p> Syringa time, Lake Pend Oreille, North Idaho. Syringa is the Idaho Sate Flower and bathes the hillside with blooms in late June. This huge glacial cut lake is 50 miles long and is over 1000 ft. deep for 1 miles. Pend Oreille holds the worldâ€™s record for largest kamloops and Dolly Varden trout. (PG 107_98, c. 1960)<br></p>
