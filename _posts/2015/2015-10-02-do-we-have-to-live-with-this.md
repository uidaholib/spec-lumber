Imagine the embarrassment... caught stealing a library book!

{% include feature/image.html objectid="lumber967" %}

In honor of Banned Books Week and the start of American Archives Month, I’m posting this to help us all remember to be kind to our books and to return them promptly to the library from which you had borrowed them, so that all may enjoy them.

Lee Zimmerman, University of Idaho’s Head Librarian from 1948-1967, is seen here perusing a display of mutilated books, surrounded by posters showing the evils of library book theft.
