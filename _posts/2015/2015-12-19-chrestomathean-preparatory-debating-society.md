Chrestomathean Preparatory Debating Society

Little is known about this debating club, as it is not mentioned in the student newspaper the Argonaut.  We only know what was written on the back: that this debate took place on March 30th, 1900, and the artist of the hand-drawn flyer was Arthur Shoup Glendenning, a junior in the B.S. course of the Preparatory branch of the University of Idaho.

The Preparatory department admitted high school students who did not have access to upper grade levels in their home towns, preparing them for admission to the University.  The Prep school existed from when the University opened its doors to students in 1892 up through the 1912/13 academic year.
