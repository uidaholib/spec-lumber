Fall Break, or the whole week off of school for Thanksgiving week.This was not the case, at least in 1942, when classes were required to be held on the Wednesday before and as well as on the following Friday and Saturday!Â  The few reports we have on these classes show quite poor attendance: the School of Business Administration reporting half to &frac34; of students attending on Friday and Saturday and the classes listed below in the College of Letters and Science having been dismissed without permission or all students absent.
