This week’s student club is Orchesis, a dance honorary created at the University of Idaho around 1948 with the first performance being May 7, 1948.  The club was organized for the advanced modern dance students, starting a tradition of dance recitals at every Christmastime and for the May Fete or Mother’s Day Weekend.The popularity of the group allowed for the inclusion of Freshmen students to be asked to join Pre-Orchesis, who then after a year were invited to Orchesis.

As a student club, Orchesis lasted up through the 1970s, although there is still a thriving dance program at the University of Idaho today.
