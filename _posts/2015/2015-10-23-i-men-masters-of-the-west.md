Totally random find in perfect time for Homecoming tomorrow, thanks to a Friday afternoon patron looking for football videos.  Even better, the theme this year is "A Hero’s Homecoming."

*In the year 1998, a new breed of Vandal Heroes emerges.  The University of Idaho Vandals took the football world by surprise when they went from being picked last in Division 1-A to winning the Big West Conference and Humanitarian Bowl championships.*

*Along the way, the Vandals crowned a new all-time rushing leader in Joel Thomas, who finished a sterling career at UI with 3,929 yards, and were honored by having their coach, Chris Tormey, chosen the Big West Coach of the Year.*

*And they won one of the most exciting games in Vandal history with arguably the boldest call ever when they went from two in overtime to beat Boise State University 36-35.*

Go Vandals!
