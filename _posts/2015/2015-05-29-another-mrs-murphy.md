Back in December I posted an image attributed to a Mrs. Murphy, of a women sitting on a man’s lap.  This Mrs. Murphy has just as few details: Mrs. Murphy and an unidentified woman in 190?.  I’m guessing the ladies are mother and daughter, since there is a strong familial resemblance, but its anyone’s guess which one is Mrs. Murphy.

Assuming the photos were taken in order, left to right and top to bottom, I love the sequence of expressions going from a fun, girls day out to “OMG, are we done yet?”
