Photo from a scrapbook that was recently donated to Special Collections.  The scrapbook was discovered tucked away on a shelf in the UI ROTC department.  As far as I can tell, the scrapbook belonged to UI Student Fred Graf, who graduated in 1921 with a Bachelor of Laws.  Graf started at UI In 1916, but was called for the draft in 1917 to serve in World War I.  As a student, Graf was halfback on the varsity football team, treasurer of A.S.U.I., assistant business manager of the yearbook, lieutenant in the cadet battalion, and was president of his class sophomore year, yet still had time for apparent girlfriend Gladys.
