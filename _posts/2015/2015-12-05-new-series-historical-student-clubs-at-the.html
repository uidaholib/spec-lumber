 <p>New series!  Historical student clubs at the University of Idaho.</p>
 <p>First up is the Vandal Flying Club, started around 1949 and continued up through the 1960â€²s.  The Vandal Flying Club was started to increase awareness and interest in aviation at an inexpensive rate.  The Flying Club first met at the Moscow Sky Ranch, then moved to the Moscow Pullman Airport, and owned its own planes for students to practice.  <br></p>
