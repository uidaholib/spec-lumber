 <p>Today’s student club is the Hell Divers, the University of Idaho Swimming Honorary.</p>
 <p>For around forty years on the University of Idaho Campus, the Hell Divers’ Club was composed of members, both men and women, who had passed the senior life-saving tests of the American Red Cross.  The club was the UI Chapter of the American Red Cross Life-saving Corps, organized on the campus in October 1930.  The work of the organization included furthering active interest and participation in swimming and water safety, to recognize swimming ability and to foster true sportsmanship.  <br></p>
