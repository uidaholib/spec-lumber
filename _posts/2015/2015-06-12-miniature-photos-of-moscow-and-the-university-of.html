 <p>Miniature photos of Moscow and the University of Idaho, published by Pacific Photo Co., circa 1918.  I thought it was interesting that these photos appear to be postcards that were cut up.  They all measure 1.75 by 2.75 inches.  They are from Historical Photograph Collection 35: Idaho Scenes.  The photos are in no particular order, the metadata we have for the images is as follows: <br></p>
