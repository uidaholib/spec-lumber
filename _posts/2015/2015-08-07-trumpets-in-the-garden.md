Legendary jazz trumpeter Doc Cheatham poses in front of the garden gate entrance presumably to a house in New Orleans, Louisiana. Ironically, the plants of that garden include the Trumpet Flower.

Born in 1905, Mr. Cheatham began playing music at the age of 15 and continued on performing until two days before he passed away, just shy of his 92nd birthday. In the last few years of his life, Mr. Cheatham had taken a liking to the people and music of New Orleans, even producing a record with local trumpeter Nicholas Peyton.
