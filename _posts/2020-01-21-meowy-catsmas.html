Inside we learn a lot about Axl:<br/><br/>“Back home in Champaign, we continue to be entertained by Axl, one of whose goals in life seems to be tripping us (preferably on stairs or in dark rooms). Another is begging for crunchy tuna treats. He also loves posing for pictures (see front), when he’s not imitating a Night Fury.”</p><p>We hope that, like Axl, this Christmas you may trip your forever family, get some tuna treats, and live your life like a Night Fury. </p><p>Meowy Catsmas!</p><p>Card found in the Herman W. Ronnenberg papers, MG 472<br/><br/></p>
