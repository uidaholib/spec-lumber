This week features photos of women playing field hockey
on campus near Memorial Gym. “Hockey is believed to date from the earliest
civilizations. The Arabs, Greeks, Persians, and Romans each had their own
versions, and traces of a stick game played by the Aztec Indians of South
America have been found.”[^1]

Encyclopedia Britannica says that “despite the restrictions on sports for
ladies during the Victorian era, hockey became increasingly popular among
women. Although women’s teams had played regular friendly games since 1895,
serious international competition did not begin until the 1970s. The first
Women’s World Cup was held in 1974, and women’s hockey became an Olympic event
in 1980….The game was introduced into the United States in 1901 by Constance
M.K. Applebee, and field hockey subsequently became a popular outdoor team
sport among women there, being played in schools, colleges, and clubs.”[^1]

Stay tuned for next week’s installment of Women’s
Recreation Wednesday!
