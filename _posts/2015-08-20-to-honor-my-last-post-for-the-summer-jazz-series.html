I am including this digitized recording that was made from a reel-to-reel tape of Lionel Hampton &amp; His Jazz Inner Circle’s rendition of a song titled Sunshine Superman.  <br/></p><p>The International Jazz Collections (IJC) was formally established at the
 University of Idaho in 2000, featuring papers and photographs of the 
legendary Lionel Hampton. <br/></p><p>Lionel Hampton was born in Louisville, Kentucky on April 20, 1908. He died on August
				31, 2002 in New York City. He showed a talent for music at an early age and by high
				school, was playing drums with a jazz band organized by his employer, a newspaper
				called the Chicago Defender. Later, he attended classes in music theory at the
				University of Southern California and gained a reputation as a great drummer on the
				West Coast. In 1930, Louis Armstrong, when working for Les Hite’s band, asked
				Hampton to fill in at an engagement at Sebastian’s Cotton Club in Los Angeles. Then,
				while at a recording session, Hampton discovered a vibraharp in an adjoining room
				and began experimenting with the instrument. He would later become recognized as the
				“King of Vibes.” </p><p>In 1936, Benny Goodman invited him to join his newly formed quartet and this
				relationship lasted for four years until Hampton decided to strike out on his own,
				forming the Lionel Hampton Orchestra in New York City in 1940. After the demise of
				the big band sound in the 1960s, Hampton changed the size and structure of his band
				and called it &ldquo;The Inner Circle.&rdquo; His professional presence in the music industry
				helped hit a new milestone as blacks and whites began to integrate the scene,
				breaking barriers that had existed before that time. In 1936, Hampton married Gladys
				Riddle who became his business manager, running all aspects of the enterprise until
				her death in 1971. </p><p>Besides touring worldwide and playing engagements at home, Hampton developed a
				working relationship with the University of Idaho in 1984 and the annual jazz
				festival became a huge success. The university honored Hampton in 1987 by dedicating
				its school of music as the “Lionel Hampton School of Music.” The festival continued
				to grow with jazz artists from around the world participating. Hampton remained
				active in the festival until his death in 2002.</p><blockquote class="bg-light pt-1 px-4 font-italic"><p>IJC MG 1 Lionel Hampton Papers, circa
