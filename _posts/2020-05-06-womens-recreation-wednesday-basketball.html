<p>Welcome back to another week of our series, Women’s
Recreation Wednesday! Today, we have photos of women’s intramural basketball
during the 1930s and 1960s at the University of Idaho.</p><p>According to multiple sources, “women’s basketball began
the year after the game was invented” in 1891 (thus, women’s basketball began
in 1892) and has a long history of “collegiate and professional teams, intercollegiate
competitions…as well as…women’s basketball at the Olympics.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>
The first women’s basketball team to ever exist was formed at Smith College.<a href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>The University of Idaho has a rich history of women’s
basketball too! The Idaho Vandals women’s basketball team has appeared in the
NCAA Tournament four times (1985, 2013, 2014, 2016) and has earned two Big Sky
Tournament championships (1985, 2016) and two WAC Tournament championships
(2013, 2014).<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[3]</a></p><p>Stay tuned for next week’s installment of Women’s
Recreation Wednesday, where we’ll talk about bowling!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="886" data-orig-width="1265"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/617377703904133120_0.jpg" data-orig-height="886" data-orig-width="1265"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="673" data-orig-width="880"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/617377703904133120_1.jpg" data-orig-height="673" data-orig-width="880"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="692" data-orig-width="905"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/617377703904133120_2.jpg" data-orig-height="692" data-orig-width="905"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="670" data-orig-width="843"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/617377703904133120_3.jpg" data-orig-height="670" data-orig-width="843"/></figure><p>Photos courtesy of <a href="http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv152953/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&amp;q=">UG
