Welcome back to another week of Oh Dam!, our series on dams in the Pacific Northwest.

Today, we’re discussing the Lucky Peak Dam, a flood control project on the Boise River about 9 miles upstream from Boise, Idaho.

The project was enabled by the Flood Control Act of 1946. Construction began in 1949 and was completed in 1955. According to the Army
Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District website, “more than $2.37 billion in potential flood damages have been prevented” since 1961 due to the Lucky Peak Dam.[^1]

Lucky Peak Dam creates the storage reservoir Lucky Peak Lake which is about 12 miles long and 3,055 feet deep at normal pool.[^1]
The lake has a visitor center and was visited by over 921,000 in 2015.[^1]
