<p>Happy Birthday Charles Dickens(1812-1870!) The University of
Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives remembers Charles Dickens on the
206th anniversary of his birth. Special Collections has two first editions of
Dickens’ novel<i> Little Dorrit</i>. Special Collections has the original serial
form of the book as it was published in nineteen monthly installments issued
from December 1855 to June 1857. Each installment was 32 pages and included two
illustrations.</p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="2609" data-orig-width="1652"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/170615503813_0.jpg" data-orig-height="2609" data-orig-width="1652"/></figure><p>The other first edition of <i>Little Dorrit</i> in University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives was published in 1857 and represents the complete work which was printed in one volume after the serialization of the story had concluded. The two works, side by side, show the installments(pictured here on the right) occupied much more room since much of the printing of the work was supported by pages of advertisement included in each story installment.</p><figure data-orig-height="200" data-orig-width="137"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/170615503813_1.png" data-orig-height="200" data-orig-width="137"/></figure><p><i>Little Dorrit</i> was Dickens’ eleventh novel. <br/></p>
