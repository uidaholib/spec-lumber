 <p>For today’s #ArchivesHashtagParty of #ArchivesArtifacts we have some paperweights made from the zinc, one of the primary metals extracted by the Bunker Hill Mining Company, as well as a scale for measuring gold or other precious metals, used in the heyday of the Coeur d’Alene Mining District.</p>
