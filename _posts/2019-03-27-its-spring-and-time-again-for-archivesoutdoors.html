 <p>Itâ€™s Spring and time again for #ArchivesOutdoors! This circa 1938 photo looks northeast across the old Fair Grounds in Moscow where school children played soft ball. There are horseshoe courts beyond, and the large white building is the Washburn-Wilson Seed Company warehouse, which burned July 7, 1945. (PG 90-01-25)</p>
