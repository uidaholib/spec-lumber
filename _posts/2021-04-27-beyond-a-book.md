The library has a new exhibit on the 2nd floor. *Beyond a Book: Artist Books from Special Collections* features books of poetry, books with creative bindings and printing, and books that don't really even look like books to demonstrate the creative ways artists have used the form of a book in their work. This exhibit is on display through August 13, so be sure to stop by.
