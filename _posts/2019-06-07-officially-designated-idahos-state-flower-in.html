 <p>Officially designated Idaho’s state flower in 1931, Syringa (philadelphus lewisii) has been the floral choice of Idaho since at least the 1890′s, when it was depicted in the state seal. These little white flowers are known for their strong, sweet fragrance, nicknamed&nbsp;“mock orange” because of the similar scent of Orange Blossoms.&nbsp;</p>
