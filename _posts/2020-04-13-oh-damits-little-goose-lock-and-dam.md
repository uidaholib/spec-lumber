Welcome back to another week of Oh Dam!, our mini-series
on dams in the Pacific Northwest.

Today, we’re discussing Little Goose Lock and Dam on the
Snake River. The project was enabled by the River and Harbor Act of 1945.
Construction began in 1963 and operation began in 1970. It creates the
reservoir Lake Bray, which “extends upstream about 37.2 miles and provides
navigation to Lower Granite Lock and Dam.”[^1]

The lock is a “single-lift lock, 86 feet wide by 668 feet
long, with a 100-foot vertical lift. More than 1.9 million tons of commodities
passed through the Little Goose navigation lock during 2015.”[^1]
