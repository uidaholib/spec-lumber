Welcome
to Week 1 of new Tumblr series, Women’s Recreation Wednesday! Today, we have
photos of women playing badminton, likely in Old Memorial Gym on campus. 



<br/></p><p>Badminton is believed to have originated in ancient civilizations
and continued through Europe in the 1600s and India in the 19<sup>th</sup>
century, evolving into the sport we know and love today.<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>
In 1934, nine members from 10 different countries formed the International
Badminton Foundation which created the world men’s tournament (Thomas Cup) in
1948 and women’s tournament (Uber Cup).<a href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>Did you know that badminton is the fastest racquet sport
in the world? The birdie can reach up to 200 mph!<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[3]</a></p><p>Stayed tuned for next week where we’ll talk about basketball!</p><figure data-orig-width="1342" data-orig-height="879" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/616743602241044480_0.jpg" data-orig-width="1342" data-orig-height="879"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="696" data-orig-height="917" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/616743602241044480_1.jpg" data-orig-width="696" data-orig-height="917"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="929" data-orig-height="711" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/616743602241044480_2.jpg" data-orig-width="929" data-orig-height="711"/></figure><p>Photos courtesy of <a href="http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv152953/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&amp;q=">UG
