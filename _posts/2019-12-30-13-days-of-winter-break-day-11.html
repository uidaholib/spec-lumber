<p>We never imagined we would be able to write so many poems in such a short amount of time. It’s almost the end of the 13 days of winter break and we’re running out of steam, so here’s a poem about the dark days of winter&hellip;</p><p>“The solstice has come and gone, <br/>It’s been at least a week.<br/>The sun is still so withdrawn,<br/>When will it reach its peak?<br/><br/>By dawn, the day is almost done.<br/>Every day seems so bleak.<br/>Any fun must be forgone,<br/>As we dream of summer’s sunny streak.”<br/><br/>(Poem by Spec Staff)<br/><br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1172" data-orig-height="2658" class="tmblr-full mb-5"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/189959955419_0.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1172" data-orig-height="2658"/></figure>
