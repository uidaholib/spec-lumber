<p><i>Cover to Cover </i>celebrates
Halloween by featuring the complete collection of the works of Edgar Allan Poe
in the University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives. Poe is
widely known for such mysterious and dark works as the stories <i>The Tell-Tale Heart, The Cask of Amontillado</i>,
<i>The Pit and the Pendulum </i>and <i>The Murders in the Rue Morgue</i>. But it is
“<i>once upon a midnight dreary, while I
pondered, weak and weary</i>,” the beginning of Poe’s immortal poem <i>The Raven</i> that feels most appropriate for
this particular holiday </p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="650" data-orig-width="1326"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/166982206218_0.jpg" data-orig-height="650" data-orig-width="1326"/></figure><p><i>The Raven,</i>
featured in the first volume of the limited edition set in Day 2 of the
University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, was first
published in 1845. It tells the story of a talking raven’s mysterious visit to
a man distraught over losing his love who eventually descends into madness. </p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="680" data-orig-width="1332"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/166982206218_1.jpg" data-orig-height="680" data-orig-width="1332"/></figure><p>Critics are divided as to the poem’s literary status, but it
remains one of the most famous poems ever written. The poem made Edgar Allan
Poe an almost instant celebrity and earned him the nickname “The Raven.” </p>
