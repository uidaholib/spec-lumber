# Local League of Women Voters Papers Processed

For the last six weeks we have been happy to host to the first Gary E. and Carolyn J. Strong Special Collections Fellowship. This fellowship was created to to increase visibility and access to our collections by offering one student the opportunity to work in the University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives and process an archival collection. 

This year’s fellow was Erin Geslani. A masters student in Cultural Anthropology, Erin chose to process the [League of Women Voters of Moscow records](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv211561/) as her project. Throughout May and June, she rehoused the materials, wrote a finding aid, and wrote a [blog post](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/posts/2021/07/02/local-issues-tackled-by-the-league-of-women-voters-of-moscow.html) for the Idaho Harvester to highlight this interesting collection. In the process, Erin learned about how archival collections are made accessible to the public and even said she found materials that relate to her masters thesis. She says she will definitely be booking an appointment in the Reading Room to delve further into the materials for her research.
