Welcome to another week of our blog series featuring our [Diverse Collections](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/diversecollections.html)! Each week, we share an archival collection that relates to or represents an underrepresented community.

This week features the [Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission Records](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv38652), 1979-1988 collection. We have 4 boxes of meeting minutes, agendas, reports, and supporting documents relating to Native American fisheries, distributed to Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission members and collected by Robert Strom, commission member representing the Nez Perce Tribe.

The Commission "coordinates management policy and provides fisheries technical services for the Yakima, Warm Springs, Umatilla, and Nez Perce tribes" and their mission is "to ensure a unified voice in the overall management of the fishery resources, and as managers, to protect reserved treaty rights through the exercise of the inherent sovereign powers of the tribes."[^1]
