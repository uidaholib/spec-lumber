Welcome to another week of our blog series featuring our [Diverse Collections](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/diversecollections.html)! Each week, we share an archival collection that relates to or represents an underrepresented community in Idaho.

This week, we're featuring a publication from the Idaho Hispanic Oral History Project in 1992.

"The Idaho Hispanic Oral History Project was undertaken to help preserve, document and encourage further research on the rich heritage of Idaho's Hispanic community. It was jointly undertaken by the Idaho Humanities Council, a state-based affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs. The project was funded by the Council and the Ethnic Heritage Committee of the Idaho Centennial Commission.

The project involved six oral history interviewers - Àngela Luckey, Martha Tórrez, Rosa Quilantán, Patricia McDaniel, María Talamantes, and Marie Sánchez Anderson - who together interviewed 22 individuals from Inkom, Pocatello, Idaho Falls, Rupert, Twin Falls, Caldwell, Nampa, and Emmett. Under the editorial supervision of University of Washington Associate Professor Erasmo Gamboa, seven of the taped oral histories have been completely transcribed, excerpts from which comprise this booklet. Although many people contributed to the success of this project, the Council thanks the staff of the Idaho State Historical Society Oral History Center for training the interviewers, and wishes to extend special acknowledgement to Dr. Gamboa and the interviewers, without whom the project could not have been completed."[^1]
