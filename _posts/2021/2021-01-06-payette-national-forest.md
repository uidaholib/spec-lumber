The Payette National Forest was originally established in 1905 but in 1944, the Weiser National Forest (established 1905) and the Idaho National Forest (established 1908) were combined to create much of the Payette National Forest that we know today.[^1]

The forest consists of 2.3 million acres of land, mostly located in west-central Idaho, and contains multiple types of landscapes, including "hot desert grasslands," "cool conifer forests," and "snow-capped peaks."[^2] Beyond the diversity in landscape, over 300 species of wildlife reside in the forest![^3]
