The Indigenous Peoples of America have a long and troublesome history, especially when it comes to the American political system. Throughout time, members of the First Nations have struggled with gaining legitimate citizenship, the enactment of voting rights, and have wrestled with voter registration limitations. Due to the multitude of past and present issues regarding the votes of the Native population, the participation in the electoral system by tribal members is the lowest when compared to other voting groups in the United States. There has been little attention given to the circumstances Indigenous Peoples of America face politically.

Towards the end of World War Two, there was a rise in the Native American enfranchisement movement. Support came from the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) who had begun a voting rights campaign soon after it was founded in 1944. However, while other minorities had complications with the marginalizing poll tax, Indigenous Americans experienced the "Indians not taxed" claim. Wolfley explains, "The phrase 'Indians not taxed' was frequently used in state constitutions and statutes to exclude Indians from voting, and is found in the U.S. Constitution" (Wolfley 1991, 184). This was first affirmed in 1917 with the court case Opsahl v. Johnson, where the Red Lake Chippewa Tribe was denied the right of voter participation.

Native Americans continued to suffer from the discriminatory act until the end of the twentieth century. In fact, "five states (Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Washington) were still doing so in 1940" (Schroedel and Hart 2015, 48). Those who were able to get around the "Indians not taxed" controversy still saw disenfranchisement in the way of poll taxes. Poll taxes were abolished in 1964 with the Twenty-Fourth Amendment due to its violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This unfortunately did not get rid of photo identification or birth certificate fees in order to provide valid documentation (Harrison 2012, 602).

Reservations have a vast number of issues when it comes to the accessibility of voting establishments. In relation to this, Schroedel and Hart explain, "Geographically isolated reservations, sometimes encompassing hundreds of miles, provide ample opportunities for vote dilution" (Schroedel and Hart 2015, 52). Besides the fact that most states have a history of not accepting registration cards from reservation addresses, there is the circumstance of the actual location of the reservation. Polling sites are usually located in towns or large cities where a number of people live closely together. There are next to none located anywhere inside reservations across the United States. In fact, in 2008, "Alaska unsuccessfully attempted...to withdraw physical polling stations from several Native villages" (Developments in the Law: Indian Law 2016, 1739).

The disenfranchisement of the Indigenous Peoples of America is a very real and current subject. More research and data analysis should be done on past and present issues concerning this topic. Disenfranchisement can only end when those involved take action. If you have questions about the history of your local tribal communities, contact tribal offices directly. They are the source for firsthand information and current events.
