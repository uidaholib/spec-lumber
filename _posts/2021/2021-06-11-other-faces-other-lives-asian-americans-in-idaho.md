Welcome to another week of our blog series featuring our [Diverse Collections](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/diversecollections.html)! Each week, we share an archival collection that relates to or represents an underrepresented community in Idaho.

This week features the VHS documentary, "[Other Faces, Other Lives: Asian Americans in Idaho](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/m1uotc/CP71161003870001451)." This documentary was sponsored by the Palouse Asian American Association of Moscow/Pullman with the assistance of a grant from the Ethnic Heritage Committee of the Idaho Centennial Commission. Lily Wai was the project administrator of the project. Eight Asian American families (specifically Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino) were interviewed about their experiences living in Idaho.
