The [International Jazz Collection](https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/) is growing! We are proud to announce the acquisition of the Duke Silver Collection. 

Originating from Pawnee, Indiana, [Duke Silver](https://parksandrecreation.fandom.com/wiki/Duke_Silver) was one of the most influential American jazz musicians of the late 20th and early 21st century. This new collection is comprised of personal correspondence, press clippings, compact discs, and memorabilia spanning his memorable career.
