Welcome to another week of our blog series featuring our [Diverse Collections](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/diversecollections.html)! Each week, we share an archival collection that relates to or represents an underrepresented community.

Today features a newspaper article from the [Women's Caucus of the University of Idaho Records](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv26340).
