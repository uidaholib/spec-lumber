According to the The Compact Atlas of Idaho "Idaho is not well known in the United States or the world and many Idahoans like it that way. Many on the east coast of the U.S still believe Idaho is really Iowa or Ohio. For those who know the name the prime association is potatoes; some know of Sun Valley, logging, mining, or running the 'River of No Return'. Most travelers cross it when driving in an east-west direction. Those in the south, on I-80, see little but sagebrush and desert, and those who cross I-90 recall mining towns and Lake Coeur D'Alene."

Though atlases are often seen as just maps, they contain so much more (including some
slightly comical views from their creators). From city roads to the stars, atlases contain facts and histories on a variety of subjects.

Currently on display on the 4th floor of the University of Idaho Library are a series of atlases that demonstrate the different types of information atlases can contain, particularly in relation to Idaho. This small display entitled *At Last, An Idaho Atlases*, showcases atlases depicting historic trails through Idaho, such as the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the Oregon Trail, as well as atlases that show the resources, terrain, and other aspects of life in Idaho.  

So be sure to stop by and see some interesting Idaho atlases!

(And remember that Idaho is neither Iowa nor Ohio)
