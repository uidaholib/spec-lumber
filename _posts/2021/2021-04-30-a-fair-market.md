A sure sign of spring in Moscow is the reappearance of the Farmers Market and the Renaissance Fair. Both beloved traditions date back to the 1970s: the Renaissance Fair emerging as a collaboration with the Blue Mountain Rock Festival in 1974 and the Farmers Market developed in 1977 as a small grass-roots gathering. The photos below are from the May 1998 Renaissance Fair and at an unknown date during the 1998 Market season.

The annual Blue Mountain Rock Festival, held on the University of Idaho campus, grew exponentially into quite a raucous and controversial event in its first three years to the dismay of university officials and some townspeople. The addition of the Renaissance Fair was a compromise to include more family-friendly options and support local craftspeople wanting to sell their wares. The community-focused Renaissance Fair took off, becoming a two-day artisan craft fair complete with a parade, live music, educational booths, food booths, a Maypole dance, roving performers, and vendors from all over the region. This year, due to COVID restrictions, the Renaissance Fair is scaled down to one day in conjunction with the Farmer's Market.

The Farmers Market is held every Saturday, May through October, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. This beloved event celebrates local farmers, artisans, musicians, and food vendors and serves as a gathering place for the community. This years Market will be starting off in-person as well as continuing a Motor-In Market where you can shop online and pick up your produce from the safety of your car.
