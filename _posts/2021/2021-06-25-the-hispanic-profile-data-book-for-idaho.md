Welcome to another week of our blog series featuring our [Diverse Collections](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/diversecollections.html)! Each week, we share an archival collection that relates to or represents an underrepresented community in Idaho.

Today features a state government publication, [The Hispanic Profile Data Book for Idaho](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/m1uotc/CP71275319430001451) by the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs in 2004. The purpose of the report is as follows:

*As the number of Hispanics in Idaho has increased over the course of the past two decades, the demand for demographic data and information regarding this population has increasingly become an essential resource for understanding and serving this community. In recognition of this need, during the summer of 2004 the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs convened a statewide inter-agency task force to collaborate in the development of the Hispanic Profile Project, a demographic report of Idaho's Hispanic community.*
