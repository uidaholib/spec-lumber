In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt visited Wallace, Idaho. These photos show President Roosevelt on 6th Street, turning onto Bank Street, in a parade. He gave a [Presidential Address](https://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Research/Digital-Library/Record.aspx?libID=o289918) that day.

Two days later, President Roosevelt visited Boise, Idaho and gave another [Presidential Address](https://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Research/Digital-Library/Record.aspx?libID=o289938).

Eight years later, in April 1911, President Roosevelt visited the University of Idaho campus. Roosevelt arrived at 6:30pm on Sunday, April 9, and took a room at the Hotel Moscow. He woke to rain and clouds the next morning, had breakfast at Ridenbaugh Hall from 7:45-8:45am "with a large and select party," planted a tree (that still stands today) in front of the Administration Building, and then spoke, just as the rain stopped, to a reported 8,000 people from a platform made of sacks of "North Idaho's famous wheat."[^1]
