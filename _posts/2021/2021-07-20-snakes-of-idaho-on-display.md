A new exhibit has been installed on the 2nd floor of the library. **Snakes of Idaho** a photograph exhibit on loan to the University of Idaho from Idaho Museum of Natural History at Idaho State University will be on display through September. Featuring photographs taken by Dr. Charles "Chuck" Peterson, a professor of herpetology, in the field throughout his career. 

This exhibit doesn't only show the unique beauty of these slithering creatures, but also demonstrates the diverse snake populations found within Idaho. Be sure to stop by the 2nd floor of the library during library open hours to see these fantastic photographs.
