Special Collections has a new exhibit up for Women's History Month! The exhibit features [Jennie Eva Hughes](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/posts/#Jennie%20Eva%20Hughes%20Smith), the first Black woman to graduate from UI in the Class of 1899. It's located outside the [Special Collections Reading Room](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/plan.html) on the first floor of the Library. Be sure to check it out this month!
