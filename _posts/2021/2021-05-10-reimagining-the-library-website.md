Our [Library website](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/) is currently themed with the [official Vandal colors](https://www.uidaho.edu/brand-resource-center/visual-style-guide/color-identity) of Pride Gold and Black. But "Wild Rose" is also an official Vandal color, and Spec thinks it should be utilized more! What if the Library website was Wild Rose instead of Pride Gold? We tested it! The world may never know, but we will!
