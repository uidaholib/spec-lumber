Welcome to another week of our blog series featuring our [Diverse Collections](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/diversecollections.html)! Each week, we share an archival collection that relates to or represents an underrepresented community.

This week features the book, [*Japanese American Contributions to Idaho's Economic Development*](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/m1uotc/CP71177581510001451) by Robert C. Sims. This book discusses how "Japanese, like other early Idaho pioneers, came to the Gem State in search of economic opportunity. Through their efforts, they not only achieved many of their own economic goals, but also made significant contributions to Idaho's economic development."
