### We're looking for him. But he knows where we are.

In recent years, the Special Collections & Archives Department has received several inquiries related to the whereabouts of the King Spud basketball trophy used in the 1960s-1970s for the basketball tournament between the University of Idaho and Idaho State University. Our archival team has searched high and low for the trophy but unfortunately, we still don't know where it ended up. We don't have it, the University of Idaho Athletics Department doesn't have it, the Idaho State University Special Collections & Archives Department doesn't have it, and the Idaho State University Athletics Department doesn't have it. 

Special Collections faculty and staff are extremely curious about where the trophy ended up. Sometimes we'll hear a faint sound in the library basement that sounds like someone saying the words "King Spud" in a breeze. 

Our computer systems often go down or become static when we mention his name in writing. 

He knows we're looking for him. 

### History of King Spud

In 1962, the Moscow Chamber of Commerce commission the King Spud trophy to be used for the annual basketball tournament between the University of Idaho and Idaho State University.[^1] The trophy went to the winning team each year through 1979 before being retired. While it was in use and after it was retired, it has drawn both criticism and a cult-like following from people who know about it.[^2]
