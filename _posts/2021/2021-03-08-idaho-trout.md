Today we have some fun fishing facts from the Idaho Department of Fish and Game! There several reasons why Idaho is a great fishing destination:
- Idaho has over 26,000 miles of rivers and streams
- Idaho has over 3,000 natural lakes
- Idaho has over 42 game fish species to catch[^1]

The Idaho state fish is the Cutthroat trout and although fishing in Idaho can be quite bountiful, you likely won't catch a fish as large as these humorous postcards from the 1980s depict!
