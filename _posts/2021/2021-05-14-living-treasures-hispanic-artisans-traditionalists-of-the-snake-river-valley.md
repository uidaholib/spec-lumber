Welcome to another week of our blog series featuring our [Diverse Collections](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/diversecollections.html)! Each week, we share an archival collection that relates to or represents an underrepresented community.

This week features the book, [*Living Treasures: Hispanic Artisans & Traditionalists of the Snake River Valley,*](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/m1uotc/CP71171378500001451) published by the Hispanic Folkarts Survey Committee in 1991.

From the Introduction:

"This survey of Traditional Hispanic Artists documents the variety and depth of traditional arts in the Hispanic communities in southeastern Oregon and southwest Idaho. It is the first step toward recognizing the strength of a cultural history that has gone unrecognized in our region. It is also a tremendous opportunity for all of us to learn about patterns of living we may never have imagined.

By studying another culture, we not only gain a better understanding of another set of values, but also about ourselves and our own values. This enhances our own quality of life. Members of The Hispanic Folk Arts Project advisory committee are committed to the idea of cultural diversity. This short publication is intended to recognize, celebrate, and preserve the Hispanic heritage; and to share and enrich the community at large.

The purpose of the Hispanic Folk Arts Survey was to document the various traditional artists in the region, and through that documentation begin to plan cultural events that would support Hispanic folk artists and traditionalists. The survey was conducted by the Center for Employment Training (CET) in Nampa, Idaho with support from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Idaho Commission on the Arts, the Oregon Arts Commission and the Whittenberger Foundation."[^1]
