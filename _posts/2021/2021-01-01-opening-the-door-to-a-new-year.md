Who's ready to close the door on 2020? We are, that's for sure! We hope these images of doors and entranceways on the University of Idaho campus help you to symbolically prepare for the exciting new potential of welcoming in a new year as we prepare to walk out into the great unknown.

The year 2020 has been thought of as many things: an unprecedented, tumultuous, paradigm-shifting train wreck that it was. Defining moments have simultaneously brought people together and pushed people apart. New Year's is a time of reflection and setting goals for a fresh start.

Many resolutions focus on starting new hobbies, many of which you could pick up supplies for at locally owned stores, safely of course.

In due time we will once again be able to welcome family and friends into our homes or hang out informally with people who share our interests.
