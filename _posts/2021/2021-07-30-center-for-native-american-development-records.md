This week's edition of [Diverse Collections](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/diversecollections.html) features our collection of [The Center for Native American Development Records](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv23261). 

The material from the Center for Native American Development, which was started at the University of Idaho in 1972 under the direction of Jack R. Ridley, is contained in one large archival file box which occupies one linear foot of shelf space. The material includes development plans for the Coeur d'Alene and Nez Perce tribes, material from the Institute on Indian Law and Jurisdiction held in November 1979 at the University of Idaho Law School, a collection of Jack Ridley's articles, material for a course on Reservation Economic Development, and miscellaneous folders from Ridley's office. The collection also includes reports and correspondence related to economic development and land use planning for the Coeur d' Alene and Nez Perce tribes.
