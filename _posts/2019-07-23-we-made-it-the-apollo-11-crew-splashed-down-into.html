 <p>We made it! The Apollo 11 crew splashed down into the Pacific Ocean on July 24th, 1969 at 12:49 am EDT (or the 23rd at 8:49pm for us in Pacific Time)! Itâ€™s been fun reminiscing about an event that no one on this team was alive for, and we certainly have enjoyed learning more about this incredible adventure!</p>
 <p>Today, we are wrapping up our moon landing posts and returning to earth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tomorrow, there is no certainty of a Tumblr post, so enjoy this one.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All the best from the University of Idaho Special Collections and Archives Team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
