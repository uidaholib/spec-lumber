This week, we have photos of women playing badminton, likely in the Old Memorial Gym on campus. 

Badminton is believed to have originated in ancient civilizations
and continued through Europe in the 1600s and India in the 19th
century, evolving into the sport we know and love today.[^1]
In 1934, nine members from 10 different countries formed the International
Badminton Foundation which created the world men’s tournament (Thomas Cup) in
1948 and women’s tournament (Uber Cup).[^1]

Did you know that badminton is the fastest racquet sport
in the world? The birdie can reach up to 200 mph![^2]

Stayed tuned for next week's edition of Women's Recreation Wednesday!
