 <p><b>It may seem early, butâ€¦</b></p>
 <p>here in the U of I Library Special Collections, we have already started prepping for Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival. Leading up to the festival in February various jazz-themed displays will begin popping up, the first of which can be found in our reading room. Be sure to stop by and see some festival memorabilia of yesteryear.&nbsp;</p>
