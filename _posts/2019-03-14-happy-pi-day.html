Today is the illustrious March 14 (3.14)! There is even a new record set for calculating Pi. Beating the previous record by 9 trillion digits, Pi has now been calculated to 31 trillion digits! To read more you can check out <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47524760">this article from BBC News.</a></p><p>Unfortunately, this wonderful number does not have a large presence in our collections. We do, however, have a picture of faculty partaking in a pie eating contest at the Forestry Barbecue, circa 1937.Â <br/></p><p>Have a great Pi Day! Be sure to calculate some of those 31 trillion digits and eat some pie!</p><p>(Historical Photograph Collection, PG 2-80-12)</p>
