Chicago Cardinals in 1950 before being called back into active duty during the Korean War.  A life-long University of Idaho supporter, he accepted a position as director of the UI Foundation in 1973 which he kept for just over 20 years.  Carl passed away 
at the age of 84 on Tuesday Oct. 6, 2009.  <br/></p><blockquote class="bg-light pt-1 px-4 font-italic"><p>PG 2-114-491; articles from UI Athletics <a href="http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17100&amp;ATCLID=204810182">“Vandal legend passes”</a> and <a href="http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=1456246">“Carl Kiilsgaard”</a><br/></p></blockquote>
