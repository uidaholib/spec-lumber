<p>University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives welcomes students back to campus this week as spring semester classes officially begin Wednesday. Donâ€™t forget Vandals, the University of Idaho Library is a great place to study.</p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="462" data-orig-width="358"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/181842178908_0.jpg" data-orig-height="462" data-orig-width="358"/></figure><p>In addition to inviting study spaces at the U of I library, you can also get creative with resources from the MILL and learn new or improve existing skills with a workshop. Tutoring assistance is also available and, of course, reference librarians are here to answer your most important questions. (PG 101-2350).<br/></p>
