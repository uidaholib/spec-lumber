<p>This Christmas Eve, we give an acrostic poem spelling out the title of the poem from the Christmas card:<br/><br/>“Tall above me,<br/>Regal with a shining crown.<br/>Every bauble glowing from the light.<br/>Earnestly, I await tomorrow.<br/><br/>Odors so clean and pure, of pine,<br/>Fading into the background.</p><p>Tenderly you will watch as thanks are given,<br/>Relishing in the sound.<br/>Everyone will step away,<br/>Even so, you will stand tall above me<br/>Silent and proud.”</p><p><br/>(Poem by Spec Staff)</p><figure data-orig-width="2089" data-orig-height="1920" class="tmblr-full mb-5"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/189848588871_0.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2089" data-orig-height="1920"/></figure><p>This Christmas Tree was designed by Mary Kirkwood and accompanied by a poem written by her colleague Ted Prichard. </p>
