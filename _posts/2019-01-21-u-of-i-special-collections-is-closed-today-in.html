 <p> U of I Special Collections is closed today in honor of Martin Luther King Jr.-Idaho Human Rights Day. Please enjoy this scheduled #mountainousmonday post of an undated photo by Kyle Laughlin of the Sawtooth Mountains from Ratcliffe’s A-frame which is adjacent to Alturas Creek. We’re not sure who Ratcliffe is. (PG 99_031-002)</p>
