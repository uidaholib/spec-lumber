commemoration is held annually to honor the authors and writing that reflect
the lives and experiences of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender
community. Included among the Special Collections and Archives book collections is
the Stonewall Collection. The Stonewall Collection consists of books proposed
for consideration for the American Library Association's Stonewall Book Awards
(including winners and honor books) as representative of the stream of
publishing representing the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender experience. These
books are award winners from 2013 that are part of the Stonewall Collection.<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="549" data-orig-width="570"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/174660416132_1.jpg" data-orig-height="549" data-orig-width="570"/></figure><p>The Stonewall Book Awards Collection was presented to
