<p>Today is #PotatoPoTuesday and we have the back of a potato postcard from the 1980s: “The Idaho Potato is featured on the menus of the swankiest supper clubs of the land, yet it is the favored and most thrifty food of the modest. Idaho now devotes 242,500 acres to produce 114,900 car loads which is 25% of the nation’s total, the greatest of any State!”</p><p>Postcard courtesy of MA2018-13 Keith Peterson Papers, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives</p><figure data-orig-width="1728" data-orig-height="1171" class="tmblr-full mb-5"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/186982536157_0.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1728" data-orig-height="1171"/></figure>
