<p>Happy Burns
Night! The night of January 25 is celebrated in Scotland and by the Scottish at
heart throughout the world to commemorate the life and work of Scotland’s
National Poet, Robert Burns (1759-1796). The first Burns supper was in 1801.
More than 200 years later, good food and readings of the poet’s work are all
that’s needed for your own Burns night celebration. University of Idaho Library
Special Collections holds an 1898 limited edition set of all of Robert Burns
work which includes his poem that may be most familiar to U.S. readers: <i>Auld Lang Syne:</i></p><blockquote><p><i>Should auld
acquaintance be forgot,</i></p><p><i>And never
brought to mind?</i></p><p><i>Should auld
acquaintance be forgot,</i></p><p><i>And auld lang
syne!</i></p><p><i>For auld lang
syne, my jo,</i></p><p><i>For auld lang
syne,</i></p><p><i>We'll tak a
cup o' kindness yet,</i></p><p><i>For auld lang
syne.</i></p><p><i>And surely
ye'll be your pint stowp!</i></p><p><i>And surely
I'll be mine!</i></p><p><i>And we'll
take a cup o' kindness yet,</i></p><p><i>For auld lang
syne.</i></p><p><i>We twa hae
run about the braes,</i></p><p><i>And pou'd the
gowan fine;</i></p><p><i>But we've
wander'd mony a weary fitt,</i></p><p><i>Sin' auld
lang syne.</i></p><p><i>We twa hae
paidl'd in the burn,</i></p><p><i>Frae morning
sun till dine;</i></p><p><i>But seas
between us braid hae roar'd</i></p><p><i>Sin' auld
lang syne.</i></p><p><i>And there's a
hand, my trusty fiere!</i></p><p><i>And gie's a
hand o' thine!</i></p><p><i>And we'll tak
a right gude-willie-waught,</i></p><p><i>For auld lang
syne.</i></p><p><i>For auld lang
syne, my jo,</i></p><p><i>For auld lang
syne,</i></p><p><i>We'll take a
cup o' kindness yet,</i></p><p><i>For auld lang
syne.</i></p></blockquote><p> The limited edition set in Special Collections
is illustrated with etchings, wood cuts, and maps. Burns was regarded as a pioneer
of the Romantic movement and is said to have influenced the works of William
Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Percy Bysshe Shelley.</p>
