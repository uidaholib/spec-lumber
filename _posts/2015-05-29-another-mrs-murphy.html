<figure data-orig-width="1806" data-orig-height="2582" class="tmblr-full mb-5"><img class="img-fluid" data-orig-width="1806" data-orig-height="2582" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/120201738683_0.jpg"/></figure><p>Back in December I posted an image attributed to a Mrs. Murphy, of a women sitting on a man’s lap.  This Mrs. Murphy has just as few details: Mrs. Murphy and an unidentified woman in 190?.  I’m guessing the ladies are mother and daughter, since there is a strong familial resemblance, but its anyone’s guess which one is Mrs. Murphy.</p><p>Assuming the photos were taken in order, left to right and top to bottom, I love the sequence of expressions going from a fun, girls day out to “OMG, are we done yet?”<br/></p>
