The balance of the machine incorporates emperial design suggested by Mr. Walter Sparks, Associate Horticulturist on the Aberdeen Station. The machine was constructed locally by Mr. Robert Knudsen of Aberdeen under the supervision of Mr. Sparks and the Aberdeen Station Superintendent. It has markedly speeded the digging of experimental potato plots.”</p><blockquote><p>PG 6-17-57, 
















Single row potato digger, 1956.</p></blockquote>
