<p>Welcome back to another week of Women’s Recreation
Wednesday, our series covering the Women’s Recreation Association here at the
University of Idaho.</p><p>This week we’re looking at women fencing at the
University. Apparently, fencing was a sport in the Olympics of ancient Greece,
dating back to 1200 AD, and has “been included in every [modern] Olympic game
since 1898.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> In
modern Olympics, “women’s fencing entered the Games in 1924 in Paris.”<a href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>Stay tuned for next week’s installment of Women’s
Recreation Wednesday, where we’ll talk about field hockey!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1319" data-orig-width="1931"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/619280278160048128_0.jpg" data-orig-height="1319" data-orig-width="1931"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1330" data-orig-width="1897"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/619280278160048128_1.jpg" data-orig-height="1330" data-orig-width="1897"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1077" data-orig-width="1348"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/619280278160048128_2.jpg" data-orig-height="1077" data-orig-width="1348"/></figure><p>Photos courtesy of <a href="http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv152953/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&amp;q=">UG
