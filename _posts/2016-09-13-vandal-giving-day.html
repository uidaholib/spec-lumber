We
are excited to be part of <a href="https://vandalsgive.uidaho.edu/giving-day/378/department/389?utm_source=scalefunder&amp;utm_campaign=amb_share&amp;utm_name=4ae0whuyh6thuaenh2oikbi&amp;utm_medium=plain">Vandal Giving Day</a>! Over the next 36 hours, a donation
of any amount will help us reach our goal of raising $10,000; we want to extend
our remodeling project to the next level! Each donation to the Library will be
matched by our Library Advisory Board members up to $10,000. We are proud to be
the state’s Most Beautiful Library—and its premier research library. </p><p>We
need help to protect our archives! Part of the next phase of library remodeling
will ensure sound stewardship of our historical treasures. Help us preserve the
past so future generations can enjoy engaging with Idaho’s history. Join
me today in making a gift to support our students and faculty! </p><blockquote><p>UG 48_6-182 Potato packing study: Union Pacific Railroad photos,    Agricultural Engineering Department Records, 1908-1979.</p></blockquote>
