<p>May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. In observance,
University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives shares photos from
its photography collection featuring a hand-made scrapbook documenting
some aspects of life in the Kooskia, Idaho Internment Camp where Japanese
American men were forced to live during World War II between the years 1943-1945.
The Kooskia camp was unique in that its inmates volunteered to transfer there
from other camps and received wages for their work. <br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="463" data-orig-width="319"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/174248798333_0.jpg" data-orig-height="463" data-orig-width="319"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="483" data-orig-width="376"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/174248798333_1.jpg" data-orig-height="483" data-orig-width="376"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="476" data-orig-width="359"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/174248798333_2.jpg" data-orig-height="476" data-orig-width="359"/></figure><p>A total of some 265 detainees occupied the Kooskia
Internment Camp at various times between May 1943 and May 1945. Although some
internees held camp jobs, most worked construction on a portion of the Lewis
and Clark Highway (now US 12) between Lewiston, Idaho,and Missoula, Montana. The
entire Kooskia Internment Camp scrapbook has been digitized and is available
