<p>Today, in 1847, Emily Bronte’s <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and Anne Bronte’s <i>Agnes Grey </i>were published in a 3 volume set under the pen names Ellis
and Acton Bell, respectively. University of Idaho Library Special Collections
and Archives holds a 12 volume set <i>Novels
of the Sisters Bronte</i> which include these classics and well as others
including works by third sister Charlotte Bronte author of <i>Jane Eyre. </i>Charlotte’s work was initially published using the pen
name Currer Bell. </p><figure data-orig-width="3024" data-orig-height="4032" class="tmblr-full mb-5"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/168542157548_0.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="3024" data-orig-height="4032"/></figure><p>The three sisters adopted male pen names initially feeling
work by female authors would not be taken seriously. Charlotte Bronte wrote “we
did not like to declare ourselves women because….our mode of writing and
thinking was not what is called feminine.” The Thornton edition set <i>Novels of the Sisters Bronte </i>in Special
Collections was published in 1905. </p>
