Yesterday, we had some verses in an attempt at iambic pentameter, there was some discussion among staff about iambic (amniotic) fluid in pregnancy, so today’s poem is about amniotic fluid. Here is a haiku:</p><p>“Giving nutrients<br/>Surrounds the growing fetus<br/>Protective liquid”</p><p>(Poem by Spec Staff)    <br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1172" data-orig-height="2658" class="tmblr-full mb-5"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/189884201157_0.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1172" data-orig-height="2658"/></figure>
