<p><i>Cover to Cover </i>It’s
Banned and Challenged Books Week! <i>Cover
to Cover</i> looks at titles in our collections which have been banned or
challenged. Our Stonewall Collection consists of books proposed for
consideration for the American Library Association&rsquo;s Stonewall Book Awards
(including winners and honor books) as representative of the stream of
publishing representing the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender experience.
Books in this collection include those awarded the Stonewall Book Awards Mike
Morgan &amp; Larry Roman Children’s and Young Adult Literature Award. Winning
titles in this category in our collection include this book by author Brian

tells the story of the relationship between Logan and Sage, two high school
seniors and eventual sweethearts in a small town in Missouri.  It deals with the issues of homophobia, hate
crimes and transgender teens. <i>Almost
Perfect</i>, was challenged in one Midwest middle school, as its librarian told
the <i>School Library Journal,</i> directly
to the district school board. After a review by a district appointed committee,
the book was removed from the middle school library and moved to the high school
library. Another result of the challenge of <i>Almost</i>
<i>Perfect</i> in this district was
requiring permission slips to check out books with “mature content” from the
middle school library. Other Stonewall award winning children’s and young adult
books in our collection include <i>The Vast
Fields of Ordinary</i> by Nick Burd, <i>Aristotle
and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe</i> by Benjamin Alire Sáenz, and
<i>Beautiful Music</i> <i>for Ugly Children</i> by Kristin Conn-Mills. Of the Top Ten Most
Challenged Books for 2016, five included LGBT characters or themes </p>
