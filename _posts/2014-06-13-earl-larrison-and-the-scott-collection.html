<p>Biology professor Earl Larrison took his late-developing fascination with Sir Walter Scott and established an extensive collection of relevant books and materials. In his professional travels (as researcher, lecturer, conference-goer) he would haunt the rare and used-book stores, seeking out first editions of Scott&rsquo;s works. He also acquired a substantial number of books about Scott and his era. Equally significant was his effort to acquire more than just the first edition; he was also interested in the subsequent changes in presentation and format as well as provenance and ownership. In 1978 he remarked: &ldquo;I was not solely interested in obtaining first editions or beautiful bindings, though I did get many of the former and a number of the latter. Rather, I tried to acquire as many of Scott&rsquo;s published works as possible, as well as critical reviews and biographies of Scott by other writers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beginning in the early 1960s, Larrison began donating his collection to the university library; by the time of his death at age 68 in 1987 the collection had grown to over 1200 volumes related to Scott&rsquo;s work and life. Among these is the first edition of <em>The Antiquary</em>(1816), often called Scott&rsquo;s favorite novel. In addition to its rich characterization of country life, <em>The Antiquary</em> includes an excellent description of how many such special collections are built and valued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here were editions esteemed as being the first, and there stood those scarcely less regarded as being the last and best; here was a book valued because it had the author&rsquo;s final improvements, and there was another which (strange to tell!) was in request because it had them not. One was precious because it was a folio, another because it was duodecimal; some because they were tall, some because they were short; the merit of this lay in the title-page, of that in the arrangement of the letters in the word &ldquo;Finis.&rdquo; There was, it seemed, no peculiar distinction, however trifling or minute, which might not give value to a volume, providing the indispensable quality of scarcity or rare occurrence was attached to it. &ndash;Sir Walter Scott, <em>The Antiquary</em>. 1816. I:61-62.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott&rsquo;s own antiquarian impulses are elaborated in his historical romances and epic poems, as in<em>Ivanhoe</em> (1820) and <em>Lady of the Lake</em> (1810), and in his recording of early ballads and folktales. But the obvious question today is whether Scott anticipated that his own books would be subject to such collecting.</p>
