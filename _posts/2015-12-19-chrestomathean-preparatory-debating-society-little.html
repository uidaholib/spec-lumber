 <p>Chrestomathean Preparatory Debating Society</p>
 <p>Little is known about this debating club, as it is not mentioned in the student newspaper the Argonaut.&nbsp; We only know what was written on the back: that this debate took place on March 30th, 1900, and the artist of the hand-drawn flyer was Arthur Shoup Glendenning, a junior in the B.S. course of the Preparatory branch of the University of Idaho.&nbsp; <br></p>
 <p>The Preparatory department admitted high school students who did not have access to upper grade levels in their home towns, preparing them for admission to the University.&nbsp; The Prep school existed from when the University opened its doors to students in 1892 up through the 1912/13 academic year.&nbsp; <br></p>
