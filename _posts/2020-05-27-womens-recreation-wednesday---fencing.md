Fencing was a sport in the Olympics of ancient Greece,
dating back to 1200 AD, and has “been included in every [modern] Olympic game
since 1898.”[^1] In
modern Olympics, “women’s fencing entered the Games in 1924 in Paris.”[^2]

Stay tuned for next week’s installment of Women’s
Recreation Wednesday!
