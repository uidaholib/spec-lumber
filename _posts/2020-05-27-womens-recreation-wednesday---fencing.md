Welcome back to another week of Women’s Recreation
Wednesday, our series covering the Women’s Recreation Association here at the
University of Idaho.

This week we’re looking at women fencing at the
University. Apparently, fencing was a sport in the Olympics of ancient Greece,
dating back to 1200 AD, and has “been included in every [modern] Olympic game
since 1898.”[^1] In
modern Olympics, “women’s fencing entered the Games in 1924 in Paris.”[^2]

Stay tuned for next week’s installment of Women’s
Recreation Wednesday, where we’ll talk about field hockey!
