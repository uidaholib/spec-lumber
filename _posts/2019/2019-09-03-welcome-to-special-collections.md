What do Joe Vandal, a cast of Dizzy Gillespie, Hiroshima roof tiles, and cuneiform tablets have in common?

They all live in the University of Idaho Special Collections and Archives, and are on display in the reading room all week. Stop by the first floor of the library, Room 121, between 10am-2pm Sept 3 through Sept 6, and see some of the interesting things we keep!
