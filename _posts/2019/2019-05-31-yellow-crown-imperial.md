A few weeks ago, we took a walk around town and saw a new flower (for us at least). This Yellow Crown Imperial stands 2-3 feet tall with the yellow blooms pointing down. Crown Imperials are native around Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, they are often cultivated as an ornamental flower in other areas. Turns out it makes for a perfect [Flowery Friday](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/floweryfriday.html).
