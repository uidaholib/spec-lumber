Itâ€™s been exactly one month since Stranger Things 3 came out and these mining photos of a hoist room and ore grinding mill from Hercules Mining Company in North Idaho look strangely similar to the giant laser that the Russians use in Stranger Things 3 to reopen the gate to the upside-down at Hawkins Lab!
