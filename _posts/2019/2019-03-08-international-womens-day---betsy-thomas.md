Happy International Women’s Day from UI Digital Initiatives!

Pictured is Betsy Thomas, who was Director of the [University of Idaho Women’s Center](https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/edu/womens-center) from 1985-1997. Thanks to Thomas’ leadership, the UI Women’s Center to this day remains one of the longest-running, continuously-operating, campus-based women’s centers in the country. A recipient of the Virginia Wolf Distinguished Service Award by the UI Women’s Center, the Rosa Parks Award from the Latah County Human Rights Task Force, and the Athena Woman of the Year Award, Betsy Thomas’ legacy is honored today by the [Betsy Thomas Gender Equity Scholarship](https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/edu/womens-center/resources/scholarships), offered by the UI Women’s Center.
