Over the last few weeks, we have noticed the flowering of many beautiful spring and summer flowers. So, we thought we would start off the summer sessions with a new series. Every [Flowery Friday](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/floweryfriday.html) we will be posting content related flowers from our collections (or walks around the neighborhood).

This daffodil was photographed by Professor Richard Naskali, likely while he lived in Ohio in the 1950′s. Naskali was a botany professor at the University of Idaho from 1967 to his retirement in 2003. He was was also the first director of the University’s Arboretum and Botanical Garden, which is a favorite spot for students, faculty, staff, and community members throughout the year.
