Here is a poem to celebrate the end of the semester:

“Finals are over,<br/>
Break has begun.<br/>
Let all the blankets cover,<br/>
As we wait for the sun.”

(Poem by Spec Staff)

Winter break is here, finals are finished, so today we are starting a short series for the 13 Days of Winter Break. Each day will feature a Christmas card from out Mary Kirkwood Christmas Card Collection and a poem from our staff. Kirkwood was an art professor at the university for 40 years, starting in 1930.  At Christmas, she would often design her own Christmas cards to send to friends and family. Below is one such card.
