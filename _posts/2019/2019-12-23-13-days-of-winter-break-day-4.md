What card shall inspire our poetry today, you ask? Why another with a woman and child...<br/>
"Is it just me, or is there a theme.<br/>
The image I see repeats it seems.<br/>A woman and child.<br/>A woman and child.<br/>
A woman and child.<br/>
The image below schemes,<br/>
To invade all of my dreams.<br/>
Kirkwood loved woman and child in reams."

(Poem by Spec Staff)
