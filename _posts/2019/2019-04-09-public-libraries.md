It’s National Library Week, so we thought we would share some of the wonderful public libraries of Idaho.

Completed in 1911, this Carnegie library is one of the few in Idaho that still serves as a public library. This photograph of the Wallace Public Library in Wallace, Idaho was taken by Barnard’s Studio in 1933.
