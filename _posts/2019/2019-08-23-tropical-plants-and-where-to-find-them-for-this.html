 <p><b>Tropical Plants and Where to Find Them</b></p>
 <p>For this #floweryfriday we were flipping through L. Bruggeman’s <i>Tropical Plants and Their Cultivation. </i>There were so many beautiful plates of flowers to choose, but <i>Hymenocallis littoralis </i>kept catching our attention. </p>
 <p><i>Hymenocallis</i> <i>littoralis</i> is a bulbous perennial herb. The large white flowers are vanilla scented and are often grown as an ornamental flower. With a name derived from the Greek <i>Hymenocallis “</i>membraned beauty” and  <i>littoralis</i> “growing by the seashore” it is not too surprising it is native to such places as Belize, Brazil, Columbia, Costa Rica, and other Southern and Central American countries. It has been naturalized to many African, Asian, and island nations. [1]<br></p>
