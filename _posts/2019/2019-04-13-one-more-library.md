We have one more library to celebrate this National Library Week, and that is the Moscow Public Library. A project championed by the Moscow Pleiades Club and the Ladies Historical Club, this library has been serving patrons for more than 110 years.

A Carnegie Library finished in 1906, it has had several renovations over the years, including the most recent addition completed in 1983. Whether you need a book, movie, CD, free Wi-Fi or some other service, this library is still serving patrons throughout the area!

We love all libraries, but some of the ones close to home have a particular tug on our hearts. Happy National Library Week! Hopefully, you spent some time in your local, historic, or academic libraries.
