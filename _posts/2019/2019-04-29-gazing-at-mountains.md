This Mountainous Monday is the start of dead week, also called no exam week, here at the University of Idaho. There are plenty of opportunities to de-stress this time of year, whether you’re enjoying nature by gazing at majestic Seven Devils Mountains or just staring absentmindedly at the tree blooming outside your window, or you could even take advantage of a free yoga class at the Student Rec Center. Or if you start to panic because you’ve just realized you need one more primary source for that paper due tomorrow, Special Collections and the Library are here to help!
