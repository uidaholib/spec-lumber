This Christmas Eve, we give an acrostic poem spelling out the title of the poem from the Christmas card:

"Tall above me,<br/>
Regal with a shining crown.<br/>
Every bauble glowing from the light.<br/>
Earnestly, I await tomorrow.<br/>
Odors so clean and pure, of pine,<br/>
Fading into the background.<br/><br/><br/>

Tenderly you will watch as thanks are given,<br/>
Relishing in the sound.<br/>
Everyone will step away,<br/>
Even so, you will stand tall above me<br/>
Silent and proud."

(Poem by Spec Staff)

This Christmas Tree was designed by Mary Kirkwood and accompanied by a poem written by her colleague Ted Prichard.
