Today's post features a humorous postcard from the 1980s. Although Idaho doesnâ€™t actually grow gigantic potatoes (sadly), it does produce about 13 billion pounds of potatoes each year, supplying roughly one-third of the United States potato crop! We love potatoes so much that Idaho even has a Potato Museum!
