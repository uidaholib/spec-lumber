MERRY CHRISTMAS!

This brightly colored Christmas card inspired a sonnet about archival ninjas:

"Archival Ninjas in the basement here.<br/>Our cardigans forever keeping warm.<br/>Our mission to protect without any fear.<br/>Historic papers left behind inform.<br/><br/>Insects have much to fear with ninjas ‘round.<br/>No ants, no spiders, silverfish can hide.<br/>If we see nibble marks, they will be found.<br/>Such pests cause damage, we cannot abide<br/><br/>We help as best we can those who visit<br/>From all around the lands to see our stuff.<br/>When they fail in their search it is implicit,<br/>Out of air we appear with no rebuff <br/><br/>To help you find unknown fun left behind<br/>With a word your search may be redefined."

(Poem by Spec Staff)
