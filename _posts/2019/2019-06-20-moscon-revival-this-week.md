It is a little known fact that Moscow, Idaho used to be home to its very own science fiction convention. Running from 1979-2001 the Palouse Empire Science Fiction Association (PESFA) organized Moscon. Moscon was a pioneering science fiction convention, perhaps the first to feature several Guests of Honor (author, artist, and scientist), to pay writers and artists for contributions to the souvenir program book, and to give away limited-edition prints of the program book covers to attendees.

This weekend, MosCon returns to the Palouse! With multiple tracks for participants to take, there is likely something for everyone.
