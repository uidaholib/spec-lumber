<p>It’s Friday, and on top of that it is National Goof Off Day! To celebrate, go out have some fun. Do something out of the ordinary, relax and goof off.</p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="725" data-orig-width="931"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/183630121043_0.jpg" data-orig-height="725" data-orig-width="931"/></figure><p>Who knows if this photograph was taken on #NationalGoofOffDay, but these employees of the Potlatch Corporation certainly weren’t taking themselves too seriously. That, or they forgot what side of the horse has a face...</p><p>Whether you take a picture with the backside of a horse or do something else, let loose today and do something a little goofy!</p><p>(Photo Courtesy of Potlatch Corporation Historical Archives, MG457)</p>
