 <p>IFC Fraternity Recruitment is going on now. The Interfraternity Council governs fraternities on campus, promoting the development of fraternity men, providing leadership opportunities, lifelong friends and more. These men participating in rush at the Beta Theta Pi house look like they are preparing for a formal job interview. (PG 2_53-2, 1960)</p>
