This #hiddenlibrary view of the ASUI-Kibbie Activity Center was taken on a snowy day kinda like today from the Library’s 4th floor mail room. The Kibbie “Dome” is home to numerous campus events, including the [Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/jazzfest) taking place this Friday and Saturday!
