It’s Friday, and on top of that it is National Goof Off Day! To celebrate, go out have some fun. Do something out of the ordinary, relax and goof off.

Who knows if this photograph was taken on #NationalGoofOffDay, but these employees of the Potlatch Corporation certainly weren’t taking themselves too seriously. That, or they forgot what side of the horse has a face...

Whether you take a picture with the backside of a horse or do something else, let loose today and do something a little goofy!
