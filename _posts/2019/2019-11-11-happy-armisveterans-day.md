On November 11, 1918, World War I ended. Twenty years later, in 1938, November 11 was dedicated to honor World War I veterans with the establishment of Armistice Day. 1954 saw Armistice Day become Veterans Day to honor, not just World War I veterans, but American veterans of all wars.[^1]

Today, we would like to honor all our veterans. The above image shows World War I soldiers marching down Main Street Moscow, Idaho in 1918. If you walk down Main Street today, you may notice U.S. flags hanging throughout town, similar to those hanging from the buildings during this parade.
