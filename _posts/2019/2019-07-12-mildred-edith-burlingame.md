These amateur #floweryfriday photographs were taken by Mildred Edith Burlingame. Mildred was an associate professor of psychology at the University of Idaho from 1942 to 1969. Her hobbies included gardening and photography, which explains the large number of slides in her papers, many of which include wildflowers. The above tiger lily (top), wild pea (bottom left), and penstemon  (bottom right) are just a few of her floral fascinations.
