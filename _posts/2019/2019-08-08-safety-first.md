These hot summer days make us want to jump in the nearest lake or river. Even our feline friends are aching for some cool water. This little guy may not be the most comfortable around water, but has come prepared to jump in while his humans complete their log drive. *Happy International Cat Day!*

WARNING: Proceed with caution! Not all cats enjoy water, this post by no means advocates placing a cat in water against its will (No matter how cute they look with their flotation devices). University of Idaho Special Collections and Archives is not liable for any scratches obtained from said actions.
