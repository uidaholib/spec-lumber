Every year we install an exhibit celebrating the Lionel Hampton and Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival. Today, we installed one of this year’s exhibits, *Here’s to the Band: The Jazz Legacy of Lionel Hampton*. Highlighting Lionel Hampton and his band, this exhibit was created with materials from our International Jazz Collection.
