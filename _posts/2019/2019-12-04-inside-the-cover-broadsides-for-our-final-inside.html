 <p><b>Inside the Cover: Broadsides</b></p>
 <p>For our final <i>Inside the Cover</i> pertaining to the exhibit <i>A Book’s Nature, </i>we are stepping away from the books on display. If you have been to the exhibit, you may have noticed these broadsides hanging on the wall. </p>
 <p>They were created between April and October 2010, when the Thomases traveled the country in their gypsy wagon visiting libraries, book arts centers, and other book artists. While traveling they created 12 broadsides in collaboration with the people they met on the trip. Each one speaks to a love of books, wandering, and craftmanship.</p>
 <p>Of those displayed here, which is your favorite? We are having a hard time deciding…</p>
 <p>And, if you haven’t stopped by the exhibit, be sure to do so before it ends on December 10th!</p>
