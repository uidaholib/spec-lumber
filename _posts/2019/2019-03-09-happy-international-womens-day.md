To celebrate, here are some pictures of one of our favorite teams from University of Idaho history, the women’s rifle team. As a part of the University cadets, these women drilled diligently and thanks to them, in 1897, the University of Idaho’s ROTC received it’s first "excellent" rating. Above is the 1897 team, Company C ("C" stood for calico).
