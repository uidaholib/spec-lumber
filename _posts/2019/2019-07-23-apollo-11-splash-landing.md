We made it! The Apollo 11 crew splashed down into the Pacific Ocean on July 24th, 1969 at 12:49 am EDT (or the 23rd at 8:49pm for us in Pacific Time)! Itâ€™s been fun reminiscing about an event that no one on this team was alive for, and we certainly have enjoyed learning more about this incredible adventure!

Today, we are wrapping up our moon landing posts and returning to earth.

Tomorrow, there is no certainty of a Tumblr post, so enjoy this one.

All the best from the University of Idaho Special Collections and Archives Team.
