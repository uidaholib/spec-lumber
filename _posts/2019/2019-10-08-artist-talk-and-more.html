Throughout the week they will be meeting with classes, performing demonstrations, and talking about their work. Stop by the second floor of the library, today at 2:00pm for an artist talk by the Thomases. They will discuss how they create books, including their experimentation with material, structure, and content. </p><p>The above broadside is currently on display in the exhibit, <i>A Book’s Nature: Artist Books by Peter and Donna Thomas</i>, on the second floor of the library.</p>
