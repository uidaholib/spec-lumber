 <p>Springtime Public Services Announcement from #ArchivesOutdoors: Spring weather on the Palouse can be very fickle, often experiencing many types of weather in one day or even in one hour. Just because it looks sunny, does not mean it wont snow, rain, sleet or hail!</p>
 <p>Maybe its just me, but this photo brings up many questions. There is no snow on the ground, and the background looks to be a partly cloudy day, but the girl is all bundled up. The title of the photo doesn’t even mention her, just “Moscow Fire Department at Bell tower” while the description does slightly better: “On the north side of Fourth Street east of the alley between Main and Washington streets. Note the hitch rail with one horse hitched to it beyond girl.” Who is she? Why the enigmatic smile while standing in front of a Justice of the Peace? Is the blurry horse behind her really the thing to note? I do love the hat, though. (PG 90-02-131, ca. 1900)</p>
