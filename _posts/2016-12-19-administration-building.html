This is a successor to the original Administration Building which burned down in 1906. Built in four sections, it is in the style of
College Gothic (a popular style amongst universities at the time) with red
pressed brick and buff-colored Boise sandstone trimmings. Designed by architect
John E. Tourtellotte of Boise, UI&rsquo;s Regents were assured that the design was
the first fireproof building in the Northwest. The first and middle sections,
which originally housed the majority of the University&rsquo;s Colleges, were begun in
1907 and completed in 1909. The North Wing, which houses
the Administration Auditorium, was completed in 1912. The South Wing (the portion of the building seen on the left in the today photo) was completed in 1920, with a library extension added in 1937, and an elevator tower added in 2000.</p><blockquote><p>PG 1-52-4; today photo by UI Library Special Collections staff; <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/campus/locations/AdministrationBuilding(New).html#more">Campus Photograph Collection</a></p></blockquote>
