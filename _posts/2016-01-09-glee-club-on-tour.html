<p>The time-honored tradition of musical clubs has not wavered 
throughout the history of the University of Idaho, from choral and glee 
clubs to the Vandaleers Concert Choir and Jazz Choir.</p><p>In the early 1920s the Glee Club went on tour, their brochure touting the positive attributes of the “U”</p><blockquote class="bg-light pt-1 px-4 font-italic"><p>Is
 it culture you want? Idaho has it. Is it a broad education? Idaho 
affords it. Is it training in Agriculture, forestry, mining, 
engineering, law, education, music, home economics? Idaho will best fit
 you to solve Idaho problems.<br/></p></blockquote><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="2239" data-orig-width="1460"><img class="img-fluid" data-orig-height="2239" data-orig-width="1460" alt="image" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/136911829883_0.jpg"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="2234" data-orig-width="3211"><img class="img-fluid" data-orig-height="2234" data-orig-width="3211" alt="image" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/136911829883_1.jpg"/></figure><p>Music continues to be an important part of UI culture locally and worldwide. For the last 40 years, the Vandaleers have traveled the globe performing concerts and programs, as well as socializing and sight-seeing.  Here is former director Glen Lockery enjoying an evening out when on tour in 1979.  <br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="941" data-orig-width="1128"><img class="img-fluid" data-orig-height="941" data-orig-width="1128" alt="image" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/136911829883_2.jpg"/></figure>
