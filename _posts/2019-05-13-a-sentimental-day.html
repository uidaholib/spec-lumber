Throughout her singing career, Day worked with several bandleaders, including Jimmy James, Bob Crosby, and Les Brown. In 1945, while working with Les Brown, Day recorded “Sentimental Journey” which became a hit. Above is an advertisement from a 1945 issue of music magazine, Metronome, for Les Brown and his Orchestra featuring Doris Day and the “No. 1 Song of the Country” “Sentimental Journey.”</p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="4032" data-orig-width="3024"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/184851344353_1.jpg" data-orig-height="4032" data-orig-width="3024"/></figure><p>Day began her movie career in 1948 with <i>Romance on the High Seas. </i>She would go on to star in 41 films and her own television show <i>The Doris Day Show. </i>Throughout her career Day starred opposite the likes of James Cagney, Cary Grant, James Garner, Howard Keel, and most memorably Rock Hudson. Many of these films highlighted Doris Day’s remarkable voice. This Downbeat article reviews the 1954 movie <i>Young at Heart</i>, starring Doris Day and Frank Sinatra. </p><p>After her five years in television, Day left the entertainment industry. She became an animal welfare activist, founding the Doris Day Animal Foundation and the Doris Day Animal League. She and these organizations continued to work to reduce the pain and suffering of animals. </p><p>Doris Day led a remarkable life and she surely will be missed. We certainly will be listening to her beautiful voice for the rest of the day. </p>
