Welcome to our new blog series featuring our Diverse Collections! Each week, we'll share an archival collection that relates to or represents an underrepresented community. 

Today, we're featuring a collection of newsletters from the Idaho Black History Museum. Our newsletters span Fall 2002-Fall 2004.
