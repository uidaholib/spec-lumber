# U.S. Army Colonel Rank Eagle Insignia Pin

This insignia pin is given to Colonels in the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force.(https://www.defense.gov/Resources/Insignia/) A Colonel is one of the most "senior field grade military officer" ranks in the military.[Colonel United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_(United_States)#Insignia) The eagle is styled similarly to the eagle on the [Great Seal of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States). The bald eagle was established as the U.S. national bird and placed on the Great Seal in 1782.[The American Bald Eagle, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/celebrate/eagle.pdf). Just like the Great Seal, the colonel insignia pin eagle is holding an olive branch and bundle of arrows in its talons, while facing left. 

Captains in the Navy and Coast Guard are equivalent in rank to Colonels in the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force. Captains receive a collar, shoulder, and sleeve insignia, one of which is this same eagle insignia pin.
