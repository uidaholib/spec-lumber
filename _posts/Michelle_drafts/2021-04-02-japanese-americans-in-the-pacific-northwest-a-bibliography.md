Welcome to another week of our blog series featuring our [Diverse Collections](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu//series/diversecollections.html)! Each week, we share an archival collection that relates to or represents an underrepresented community.

This is a bibliography prepared by the Staff of the Tacoma Public Library from materials found in the collections of the Library.
