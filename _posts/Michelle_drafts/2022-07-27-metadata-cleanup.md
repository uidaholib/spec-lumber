Sometimes you come across metadata that is especially messy! Check out some of these dates from one of our spreadsheets:

{% include feature/image.html objectid="lumber1477" %}

{% include feature/image.html objectid="lumber1478" %}

{% include feature/image.html objectid="lumber1479" %}

{% include feature/image.html objectid="lumber1480" %}
