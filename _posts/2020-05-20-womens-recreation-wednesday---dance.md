Welcome back to another week of Women’s Recreation
Wednesday, our series covering the Women’s Recreation Association here at the
University of Idaho.

This week we’re looking at the folk-dance festivals that
were held at the University of Idaho in the 1960s, along with photos of women
doing folk dances.

A little background on folk dancing: “Folk dances are
usually danced at social gatherings…that can but are not required to have a
particular dancing stage and are almost always so simple to dance that new
dancers and amateurs are encouraged to start dancing with everyone else. Such
dances almost never have an official governing body that is keeping the development
of folk dance in check. Instead of that, the morphing of the folk dances in
their countries and local regions happens spontaneously by the changes with
local traditions. Modern dances that have developed spontaneously such as hip
hop are not regarded as folk dance, and they are often called ‘street dances.’”[^1]

In 1989,
Idaho became the tenth state of a total of 28 that officially chose the square
dance as an official state dance. Idaho law declared that “the folk dance,
known as the square dance, is hereby designated as the American folk dance of
Idaho.”[^2]

Stay tuned for next week’s installment of Women’s
Recreation Wednesday, where we’ll talk about fencing!
