 <p>Have you seen this #hiddenlibrary sign? This inspirational plaque stood next to the entrance until the 1991 remodel moved the entrance to the north side of the building. It’s actually still there, just currently obscured by the landscaping. (PG 1-122-080, Library entrance plaque - “Here is the knowledge of centuries past that all may come and share today.” 1957 Photographer: UI Photo). &nbsp; </p>
