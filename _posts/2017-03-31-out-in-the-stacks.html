Here is our Stonewall Collection, consisting of books proposed for consideration for the American Library Association's Stonewall Book Awards (including winners and honor books) as representative of the stream of publishing representing the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender experience starting with the first book <i>Patience and Sarah</i> by Isabel Miller, published in 1971. While at first glance it might not go beyond the LGB and T, or in this case GLBT, I can’t pass up an opportunity to highlight one of our collections. :)</p>
