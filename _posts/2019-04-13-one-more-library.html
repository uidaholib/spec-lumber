A project championed by the Moscow Pleiades Club and the Ladies Historical Club, this library has been serving patrons for more than 110 years.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="699" data-orig-width="1100"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/184158578535_1.jpg" data-orig-height="699" data-orig-width="1100"/></figure><p>A Carnegie Library finished in 1906, it has had several renovations over the years, including the most recent addition completed in 1983. Whether you need a book, movie, CD, free Wi-Fi or some other service, this library is still serving patrons throughout the area!</p><p>We love all libraries, but some of the ones close to home have a particular tug on our hearts. Happy National Library Week! Hopefully, you spent some time in your local, historic, or academic libraries.Â </p><p>(PG 5-001-02bb, PG 9-02-03a)</p>
