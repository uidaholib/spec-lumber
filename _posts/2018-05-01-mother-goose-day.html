<p><i>Cover to Cover</i>
celebrates Mother Goose Day. According to the Mother Goose Society the
fictional character of Mother Goose was first associated with children’s
stories in 1697 when Charles Perrault used the phrase in a published collection
of eight fairy tales. Although the book was titled, (translated from French) <i>Histories
and Tales of Long Ago, with Morals</i>, the frontispiece showed an old woman
spinning and telling stories, with a placard on the page which bore the words <i>Contes
de la Mere l'Oye</i> (Tales of My Mother the Goose). The single most important
promoter of the designation of Mother Goose as writer of children&rsquo;s rhymes was
John Newbery with his adoption of her name for a collection of mostly traditional
rhymes; <i>Mother Goose’s Melody or Sonnets
for the Cradle in Two Parts. </i>This version was believed to have been first
published as early as 1765. University of Idaho Library Special Collections and
Archives holds a 1945 reprint of a 18th century U.S. edition. <br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="1135" data-orig-width="750"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/173480704231_0.jpg" data-orig-height="1135" data-orig-width="750"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="1135" data-orig-width="750"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/173480704231_1.jpg" data-orig-height="1135" data-orig-width="750"/></figure><p> In two parts, the first selections include what we
