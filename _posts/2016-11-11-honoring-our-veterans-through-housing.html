Title V of this act, approved June 23, 1945, focused on re-purposing or moving existing dwelling units for housing distressed families of servicemen and for veterans with families. </p><p>At the University of Idaho, a sharp increase in students returning from World War II and a lack of available on-campus housing caused UI President Harrison Dale to apply to the federal government for residential units both on and off campus, as supplied by the Lanham Act. While these campus dwelling units were not prestigious, they quickly became popular cooperative communities known as ‘Vet Villages.’</p><blockquote class="bg-light pt-1 px-4 font-italic"><p>Images from top: PG 1-120-1,
