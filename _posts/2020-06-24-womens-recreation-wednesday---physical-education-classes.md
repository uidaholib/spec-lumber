Welcome back to another week of Women’s Recreation
Wednesday, our series covering the Women’s Recreation Association here at the
University of Idaho.

This week’s photos are from Women’s Recreation
Association Physical Education classes. If you’re interested in learning more
about the history of Physical Education classes for women, there’s a great book
titled “Active Bodies: A History of Women’s Physical Education in
Twentieth-Century America” by Martha H. Verbrugge!
