This week’s photos are from Women’s Recreation
Association Physical Education classes on campus. If you’re interested in learning more
about the history of Physical Education classes for women, there’s a great book
titled “Active Bodies: A History of Women’s Physical Education in
Twentieth-Century America” by Martha H. Verbrugge!

Stay tuned for next week’s installment of Women’s
Recreation Wednesday, where we’ll talk about the ROTC and women’s rifle team!
