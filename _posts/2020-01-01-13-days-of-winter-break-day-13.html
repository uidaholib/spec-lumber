<p><b>Happy New Year! </b></p><p>You did it! You survived the 13 days of winter break and the onslaught of random poetry brought to you by our staff. Tomorrow our office, Tumblr and lives will return to normal as we wait for the spring semester to begin. So I will leave you with one last poem and Christmas card from Mary Kirkwood. May your New Year be splendid! </p><p>“With so much verse between us<br/>We do hope you will come to see us<br/><br/>Our materials hold more than cards<br/>In fact, they span several thousand yards<br/><br/>Forestry, mines, Idaho and more<br/>There certainly is much to explore<br/><br/>We hope to see you soon<br/>Because reference makes us swoon”<br/><br/>(Poem by Spec Staff)</p><figure data-orig-width="1095" data-orig-height="1614" class="tmblr-full"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/189998242079_0.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1095" data-orig-height="1614"/></figure>
