They are most prominently seen along Campus Drive, but also can be found in the Arboretum and Botanical Garden. From the <a href="http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/argonaut/id/10485/rec/1">04 December 2001 Argonaut</a> student newspaper: ‘These
trees are often described as &ldquo;upside down trees&rdquo; because their
weeping branches and knotty trunk are formed by being grafted upwards.
Normally, the Camperdown elm grows along the ground like a bush. For the trees
to grow upright, they must be grafted along the bark. The ones at UI are
grafted with regular wild elm from the ground up to about four feet.’</p><blockquote><p>UA 1987-17, 1970s; today photo by UI Library Special Collections staff.</p></blockquote>
