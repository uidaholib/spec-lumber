Welcome back to another week of our series, Women’s
Recreation Wednesday! Today, we have photos of women bowling in the 1960s.

Did you know that the first indoor bowling alleys were
opened in New York City in the 1840s?[^1]
According to one website, “women began bowling in the 1880s despite it being
socially unacceptable to do so.”[^1]
Today, the Professional Women’s Bowling Association and Women’s International
Bowling Congress are just a couple associations for women bowlers!

Stay tuned for next week’s installment of Women’s
Recreation Wednesday, where we’ll talk about dance!
