This week, we have photos of women bowling in the 1960s.

Did you know that the first indoor bowling alleys were
opened in New York City in the 1840s?[^1]
According to one website, “women began bowling in the 1880s despite it being
socially unacceptable to do so.”[^1]
Today, the Professional Women’s Bowling Association and Women’s International
Bowling Congress are just two of many associations for women bowlers!

Stay tuned for next week’s installment of Women’s
Recreation Wednesday!
