 <p><b>A Book’s Nature</b></p>
 <p>Books that roll, books that scroll, books that stretch! Painted, printed, cut, and more! Books both small and tall!</p>
 <p>Our new exhibit opens today, full of beautiful artist books created by Peter and Donna Thomas. The Thomases have been creating&nbsp;“fine press” and artist books for over 40 years, and this exhibit displays a wide range of their works. Their creative work with paper, printing, and binding have made for a beautiful exhibit. We are thrilled that we have the opportunity to share these works with others. Be sure to stop by the 2nd floor of the library to see these beautiful creations.&nbsp;<br></p>
 <p>Thanks to Library Advisory Board member Gary E. Strong for lending us these books to display.&nbsp;</p>
