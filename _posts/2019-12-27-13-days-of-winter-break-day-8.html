<p>This poem is set to the melody of “What Child Is This,” it is called “What Day is This?”<br/><br/>“What day is this?<br/>I’m losing track.<br/>No school or work to keep me.<br/>Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+<br/>I curl on the couch sleeping.</p><p>Tumblr posts written past<br/>Post now as they were scheduled<br/>Yet, I think not of these things,<br/>For I am still home sleeping.</p><p>What, what day is this?<br/>I’m losing track <br/>How, how much is left<br/>Of this glorious break</p><p>Oh what shall I do until that day<br/>When life returns to normal?<br/>I shall eat leftovers and cookies<br/>Enjoying my last days of freedom. </p><p>

What, what day is this?<br/>I’m losing track <br/>How, how much is left<br/>Of this glorious break”<br/></p><p>(Poem by Spec Staff)</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1694" data-orig-width="1390"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/189902777480_0.jpg" data-orig-height="1694" data-orig-width="1390"/></figure>
