As the semester begins, I hope all the new and returning students are adjusting to college life. Special Collectionsâ€™ staff have also been adjusting to our new Reading Room, moving in new technology and old favorites of ready reference materials. Special Collections has gone through a few moves throughout the years, whether it be to new facilities or to adjust for new collections. Here Special Collections Librarian Charles Webbert (left) and Photo Center Supervisor Ed Breidenbach are moving in negatives from our [Barnard-Stockbridge Photograph Collection](http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/barstock/).
