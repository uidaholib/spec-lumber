Vandal Football legend Carl Kiilsgaard passes a potato for a publicity stunt sometime during his student tenure from 1946 to 1949.  After graduation, Carl was drafted and briefly played for NFL’s 
Chicago Cardinals in 1950 before being called back into active duty during the Korean War.  A life-long University of Idaho supporter, he accepted a position as director of the UI Foundation in 1973 which he kept for just over 20 years. Carl passed away at the age of 84 on Tuesday Oct. 6, 2009.
