We are excited to be part of Vandal Giving Day! Over the next 36 hours, a donation of any amount will help us reach our goal of raising $10,000; we want to extend our remodeling project to the next level! Each donation to the Library will be matched by our Library Advisory Board members up to $10,000. We are proud to be the state’s Most Beautiful Library—and its premier research library.

We need help to protect our archives! Part of the next phase of library remodeling will ensure sound stewardship of our historical treasures. Help us preserve the past so future generations can enjoy engaging with Idaho’s history. Join me today in making a gift to support our students and faculty!
