This year the first day of Spring falls on the last day of our Spring Break.  Despite still being a bit chilly, with snow in the higher elevations, its a great time to head outside to enjoy nature.  Here the photographer’s dog, Rockey, looks to be having a good time hiking along near Benton Creek on the North Fork of the Clearwater River.  This area was inundated with the creation of the Dworshak Dam and resulting Dworshak Reservoir.
