Active apparently only in 1975, the Idaho Star Trek Club had at least 13 members.Â  With brief mentions of a possible local chapter of a fan club in the 1980s and 1990s, and online interest just recently, there might still be some Star Trek fans out there on the Palouse.

While this post is concluding the [Historical Student Clubs](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/historicalstudentclubs.html) series, it is also ushering in our new library-wide [Potato Potuesday](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/series/potatopotuesday.html) event where every Tuesday we celebrate this delicious tuber.
