The Women’s Recreation Association was open to all women on the University of Idaho campus, promoting all types of fall, winter and spring sports as well as folk and modern dancing.  The WRA organized both intramural and extramural teams, no doubt with help from the physical education department.  Here are the Women’s PE faculty, left to right, Nat Wells, Maxine Richardson, Margaret Coffey, Mabel Locke, and Billie Reeves enjoying an afternoon out on the Administration lawn with a dog that apparently bit University President Jesse Buchanan, causing a ruling that dogs were no longer allowed in buildings.
