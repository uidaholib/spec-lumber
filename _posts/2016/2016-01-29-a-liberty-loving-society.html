The debate has taught us to honor our nation’s heroes, to study our country’s literature, and to love our republican institutions. There is not another organization in the University where young men and young women can cultivate the art of debate more fully than in the Websterian Society.’ - University Argonaut, March 1st, 1899.<br/></p>
