In honor of the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival #hampjazz starting tomorrow and the University of Idaho Libraryâ€™s new Tuesday series, #potatopotuesday, I am posting this photo from the [Lee Morse Collection](http://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/morse_lee/index.html). Apparently Lee could make an excellent potato salad.

One trouble, though... Can anyone help me with who Jay is?
