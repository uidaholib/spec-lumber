The Spokane & Inland Empire Railway was a popular ‘interurban’ or electric-powered passenger train that connected Spokane, WA to cities around the Palouse region. The Washington, Idaho & Montana Railway was a freight and passenger rail that served residents of and the Potlatch Lumber Company in Latah County, Idaho. Both railways, along with the Northern Pacific Railway Company, met up in the town of Palouse, WA, in the heart of rolling wheat fields.
