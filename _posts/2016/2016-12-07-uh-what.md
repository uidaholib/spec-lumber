This year the University of Idaho Vandals will be playing in the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, the longest-running cold weather bowl game in college football. Idaho has an even longer history with the starchy tuber: here Len Zenkevitch is posed with New Sweden Idaho Potatoes in 1940. Much to our dismay, though, its a pretty safe bet that the bowl game will be played with an actual football and not a giant Idaho potato.
