Friendship Square in the heart of downtown Moscow, Idaho was established in 1971. Trees and benches were installed that same year. The space started as the Downtown Plaza with the closing of 4th street to traffic. The Square was revitalized in 1981, adding the fountain, more trees and benches, and sidewalks to make the area more inviting, as well as became the home to the Saturday Farmers’ Market. A children’s playground was added in 2005, more benches were installed in 2006, and in 2012, the Square once again is home to the Farmers’ Market, which now stretches from 3rd to 6th streets on Main Street.
