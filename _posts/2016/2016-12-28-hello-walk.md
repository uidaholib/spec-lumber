Hello Walk, the pathway leading from the main entrance of the Administration Building to the Old Greek section of campus. Hello Walk was named for UI President Alfred Horatio Upham, who was appointed December 1, 1920. A friendly and
out-going scholar, President Upham would say ‘hello’ to each student he passed on his way to and from his office.
