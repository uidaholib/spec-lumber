Originally a muddy slope leading to a pathway through plowed farmland, then wooden, then concrete, these steps mark one end of Hello Walk. Remodeled in 2012, the Hello Walk steps are now a stately entrance to the heart of campus, symbolically connecting the town of Moscow, Idaho and the University of Idaho.
