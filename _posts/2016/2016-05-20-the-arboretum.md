New summer series, then and now on the Palouse!  Here is the University of Idaho Arboretum and Botanical Garden as it looked like in the late 1970s and 2016.  The two versions show opposite ends of the Arboretum, which is organized into geographical groupings of Asian, European, Eastern, and Western North American sections, as well as having display plantings of hundreds of species and cultivars of North Temperate trees and shrubs and a xeriscape garden.  The top images are from Nez Perce Drive, across the street from the UI President’s House, and the bottom images are from the Southern edge, adjacent to Palouse River Drive.
