Through a collaborative effort between Special Collections and the MILL (Making, Innovating, and Learning Laboratory), the University of Idaho Library entered a life size replica of the first iteration of our Vandal mascot into the Homecoming Parade last Saturday morning. This Vandal, created by student editor Peter Paul Drus and whom we affectionately refer to as Baby Joe, first appeared in the 1924 Gem of the Mountains yearbook as well as a small statue. The original statue, which resides in Special Collections, is below. Big ‘Baby Joe’ also made an appearance in the Idaho Fan Zone to help us sell our newly published book [“University of Idaho, the Campus History Series.”](http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/arcadia.html)
