2nd Street, looking East from Main Street, Moscow, Idaho,
1896 and today. The prominent building
on the corner is part of what was originally known as the Browne Block. Built
by Robert S. Browne, this was comprised of two buildings on the Southern half
of the block on Main Street between 1st and 2nd Streets. Browne designated the
corner building as the Moscow National Bank, which he also founded. The Moscow National Bank was in business only
from 1891 to 1897. Browne left Moscow shortly after the failure of his bank. Banking continued in this building when it
became the Moscow State Bank, which existed until the Great Depression. Â In 1936, after a couple of years of vacancy, the
building was re-branded as the Latah County Title Company which still occupies
the location today.
