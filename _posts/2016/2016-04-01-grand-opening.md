Today at 2 p.m. PDT is the grand opening and ribbon cutting ceremony for our newly renovated first floor.  10 years in the making, the new first floor will feature a 24-hour welcoming space complete with comfy couches and study space and a cafe. Also new to the Library is the MILL, or Making, Innovating and Learning Laboratory. For more information: please visit student newspaper The Argonaut article [Turning the page — Library renovations formally unveiled](https://www.uiargonaut.com/2016/03/31/turning-the-page-library-renovations-formally-unveiled/?platform=hootsuite). 

For some Library nostalgia, above is an image of the Library 99 years ago.
