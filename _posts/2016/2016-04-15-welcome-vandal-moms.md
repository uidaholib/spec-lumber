The Mom’s Weekend tradition continues this weekend at the University of Idaho.  In the 1970s and 80s, Mom’s and Dad’s weekends were combined to be one Parent’s Weekend, also held in the Spring.  While the programs change throughout the years, one event still continues: the Turtle Derby where campus resident groups race turtles in a friendly competition to raise money for local charities.
