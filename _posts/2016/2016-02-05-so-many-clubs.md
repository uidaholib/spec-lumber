Next week I will be wrapping up the #Student Clubs series, although today’s find did leave an opening for a continuance down the road. 

The Committee on Student Organizations seemed to be involved in organizing or at least classifying each student group on campus, similar to today’s [Department of Student Involvement](http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/department-of-student-involvement).

The Committee on Student Organizations also had the task of initially approving possible new Greek societies to form at the UI.

The Chi Delta Phi sorority was founded at the University of Idaho in December 1915, and accepted into the national sorority Kappa Alpha Theta five years later.  Kappa Alpha Theta is still active on campus today.
