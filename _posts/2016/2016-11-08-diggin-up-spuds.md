According to the caption on the back of the image: "This machine incorporates the rotating rod digger point designed by a local potato grower. The balance of the machine incorporates emperial design suggested by Mr. Walter Sparks, Associate Horticulturist on the Aberdeen Station. The machine was constructed locally by Mr. Robert Knudsen of Aberdeen under the supervision of Mr. Sparks and the Aberdeen Station Superintendent. It has markedly speeded the digging of experimental potato plots."
