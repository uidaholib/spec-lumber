Blue Key, a national honor society, became a part of the Vandal community in 1925, shortly after it originated at the University of Florida in 1924 Blue Key had a strong start at the UI, composed of upper class students who were leaders in various student activities and maintained a vital presence on campus up until the 1990s.  Students in Blue Key helped with everything from publishing the student handbook, recruitment and retention of incoming students, and what they were best known for, their annual talent show.
