Happy International Archives Day! To celebrate, here is the first mention of a Special Collections at the University of Idaho Library.

In 1933, Librarian extraordinaire M. Belle Sweet typed up this memo stating the desire to create a separate collection, shelved in a protected area (albeit an old unused elevator shaft) for all rare, valuable, or historic library materials. 83 years later, some of those materials are still housed safely and securely in Special Collections and Archives.
