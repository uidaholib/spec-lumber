In the event of too much turkey consumption over the holiday weekend, there is available the Poro-Plastic Corset! "Seamless, yet unwoven, light, porous, permitting all the functions of healthy action, typical elegance of form, yet clasping the figure and affording firm support, and made from [felt,] a light and porous non-conducting material, which possesses the advantage of being warm in winter and cool in summer."
