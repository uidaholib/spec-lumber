Happy Homecoming Week, Vandals! Good luck in the game against Troy University this Saturday, October 1st!

Here again is the 1940 football team, this time rushing the opposing team, a stack of New Sweden Idaho Potatoes. Left to right is Rex Engelking, Tom Solinsky, Paul Ryan, George Nixon, LaVern Bell, Mac Beall, Earl Acuff, Maynard Heien, Mill Michlich, and Vic Berllus. The team traveled with New Sweden Potatoes throughout the 1940 season, advertising the giant Idaho tubers.
