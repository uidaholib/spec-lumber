Trees have been an integral part of the University of Idaho Campus from the beginning when the university was founded in 1889.  As shown in the first general catalog highlighting classes for the 1893/94 academic year, students had the opportunity to study botany, agriculture, horticulture, and even landscape gardening.  Above is the class of 1901 planting a tree on Admin Lawn for Arbor Day in 1900.

Here are members of that class, posing in front of their tree 50 years later.
