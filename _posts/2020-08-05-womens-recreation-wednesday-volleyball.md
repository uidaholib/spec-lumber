Welcome back to another week of Women’s Recreation
Wednesday, our series covering the Women’s Recreation Association here at the
University of Idaho.

Volleyball was reportedly invented by William G. Morgan
in 1895 just four years after the invention of basketball.[^1]

An early example of a women’s volleyball game was the
Central American and Caribbean Games in San Salvador in 1933.[^2]

The first Women’s World Volleyball Championship was held in Moscow, Russia in
1952.[^3]

The U.S. National Women’s volleyball team began to train for the 1984 Olympics
in 1975 and ultimately won the silver medal! The Women’s Professional
Volleyball Association was formed in 1986.[^4]

Stay tuned for next week’s installment of Women’s Recreation
Wednesday!
