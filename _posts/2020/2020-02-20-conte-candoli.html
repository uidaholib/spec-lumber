Throughout his career, Conte played trumpet in the bands of Woody Herman, Chubby Jackson, Stan Kenton, Charlie Ventura, and even his own.</p><p>In 1967, Conte began making occasional appearances with Doc Severinson’s band on the <i>Tonight Show.</i> When Johnny Carson moved the show from New York to California, in 1972, Conte became a permanent fixture. He played for the band until 1992 when Johnny Carson retired. </p><p>Candoli also consistently had studio work, often backing artists like Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald. He would also often work with his brother, Pete. </p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="1862" data-orig-width="1474"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/190920013963_1.jpg" data-orig-height="1862" data-orig-width="1474"/></figure><p>Conte Candoli performing on the <i>Tonight Show. </i></p><p><i>Photograph Courtesy of the Conte Candoli papers, IJC MG 17</i></p>
