Our second Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival display is now up at the library just in time for the semester to start. Featuring jazz vocalists that have made their way through Idaho and the Jazz Festival, *Voices of Jazz: Legends That Inspire* highlights the incredible talent and skill of jazz vocalists. Stop by the 2nd floor of the library to see the display, it will be up through March 13th.
