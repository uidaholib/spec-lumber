Welcome to our new series, What's Bugging You, where we highlight the vast research held in our collections on the pests and diseases plaguing Idaho forests. Some of the topics we will include are Tussock Moths, Pine Beetles, Blister Rust, and some of the chemicals and techniques used to combat damage done to the trees. 

About 21.5 million acres in Idaho, or about 40% of the state, is covered in trees.[^1] Insect and disease outbreaks are some of the leading causes of forest destruction. With this series, we hope to inform viewers of the symptoms and causes of damage seen to trees primarily in North Idaho. Stay tuned for more!
