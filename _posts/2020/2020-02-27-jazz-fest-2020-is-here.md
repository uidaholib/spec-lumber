We cannot contain our excitement (and neither can Al Grey), the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival is finally here!

We are excited to see all the exhibits, partake in the dance and music workshops, and enjoy the evening concerts with some incredible jazz artists. To see all that is happening, be sure to check out this yearâ€™s [program](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/jazzfest/about/program-archives/2020).
