Welcome to our new series, Women’s Recreation
Wednesday! This series will feature photos from the University of Idaho Women’s
Recreation Association between the 1920s-1960s.

Recreation at University of Idaho existed as early as
1984-1985, although it’s not clear if that’s when Campus Recreation first
started (it’s just the earliest date that we could find on record). According
to an early brochure, “Campus Recreation is a multi-dimensional program
composed of Swim Center activities, Intramural Sports, Informal Recreation and
Special Events.”[^1]

The images featured in this series come from the [University of Idaho Women's Recreation Association Photographs](http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv152953/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&amp;q=). Unfortunately, not much is known about
this association, but since many of the images are well before the 1980s –
including some as early as the 1920s – it’s thought that the Women’s Recreation
Association was separate from Campus Recreation.

Stay tuned for next week’s edition of Women’s Recreation
Wednesday!
