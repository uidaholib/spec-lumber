In October 1918 an Influenza Pandemic came to the University of Idaho. Upon its arrival the university took quick action to limit its spread. Following procedures recommended by the government including quarantine, gauze masks, event cancellations and more, the university weathered the disease. The new [1918 Flu Pandemic Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/1918flu/) looks at how the pandemic affected the university through clippings from the school paper the Argonaut, photographs, diary entries and more.
