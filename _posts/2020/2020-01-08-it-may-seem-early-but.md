It may seem early, butâ€¦here in the U of I Library Special Collections, we have already started prepping for Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival. Leading up to the festival in February various jazz-themed displays will begin popping up, the first of which can be found in our reading room. Be sure to stop by and see some festival memorabilia of yesteryear.
