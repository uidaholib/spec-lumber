This beautiful tiger graces the back of a jacket that belonged to what great jazz trumpeter?

As a teenager, he played with Woody Herman’s band during his summer vacations.

In 1972, he became a permanent member of the band led by Doc Severinson for Johnny Carson’s *Tonight Show*. 

He is the younger brother of another well-known jazz trumpeter.

Finally, materials from both he and his brother reside in the University of Idaho’s International Jazz Collection.
