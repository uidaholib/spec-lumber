Welcome back to another week of Women’s Recreation
Wednesday, our series covering the Women’s Recreation Association here at the
University of Idaho.

This week’s photos feature women playing softball near
the University Library and Memorial Gym. Softball developed out of indoor
baseball, which was invented in Chicago in 1887.[^1] “Women’s fast-pitch softball became an official sport of the Summer in 1996 but
was dropped in 2012. Still, that hasn’t deterred millions of enthusiasts in the
U.S. and more than a hundred other countries from pursuing the sport.”[^2]

Stay tuned for next week’s installment of Women’s
Recreation Wednesday, where we’ll talk about swimming!
