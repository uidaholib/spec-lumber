Welcome to another week of Oh Dam!, our series on
dams in the Pacific Northwest.

Today, we’re discussing the installation of turbines and
generators. Water turbines are a type of rotary machine that converts
water’s kinetic energy into electric power.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers explains how turbines
and generators work: “A hydraulic turbine converts the energy of flowing water
into mechanical energy. A hydroelectric generator converts this mechanical
energy into electricity. The operation of a generator is based on the
principles discovered by Faraday. He found that when a magnet is moved past a
conductor, it causes electricity to flow. In a large generator, electromagnets
are made by circulating direct current through loops of wire wound around
stacks of magnetic steel laminations. These are called field poles, and are
mounted on the perimeter of the rotor. The rotor is attached to the turbine
shaft, and rotates at a fixed speed. When the rotor turns, it causes the field
poles (the electromagnets) to move past the conductors mounted in the stator.
This, in turn, causes electricity to flow and a voltage to develop at the
generator output terminals.”[^1]
