Today *Cover to Cover*
looks at the *Cyclopaedia of Costume or Dictionary of Dress* written by James Planché from 1876-1879 and part of the
University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives rare book collection. Planché was a playwright but became known as an expert on historical costume after researching costumes for productions of stage plays. The dictionary uses a variety of methods for illustrating the historical types of
dress it describes including reproductions of well-known paintings and a variety of illustrations. The illustration included in the front cover is a portrait from the mid 1390’s of the English king Richard II, shown below, the
earliest known portrait of an English monarch.

The full title of Planché's two volume work is *A cyclopdiea of costume, or a dictionary of dress, including notices of contemporaneous fashions on the continent; a general chronological history of the costumes of the principal countries of Europe, from the commencement of the Christian era to the accession of George the Third.* Planché's attention to detail can be noted throughout the book with
the reader finding almost four pages on an entry about gloves or a detailed illustration about the type of breast plate worn by knights over the centuries.
