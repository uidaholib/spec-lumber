This weekend is our second UIdaho Bound event, where newly admitted students can experience campus life, register for classes, meet their professors, and get all the information needed to become a Vandal. Welcome future Vandals!

Library tours are today from 3-5 p.m. and tomorrow (Saturday) from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. Be sure to stop by the Special Collections Reading Room!
