In celebration of summer weather finally coming to Idaho, we are starting a new series, #tailsfromthepast ! Historic photos of pets (and their people) from our collections.

Before we know it, it will soon be the dog days of summer, so enjoy this photo from the Slippery Gulch Pet Parade in Wallace, Idaho, featuring an array of furry friends!
