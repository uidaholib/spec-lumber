The first day of Fall classes at the University of Idaho coincides with the solar eclipse. As Idaho is in the path of totality, many places are gearing up for the event, including the UI Idaho Falls branch closing for the day in anticipation of hundreds of thousands of people visiting Southeast Idaho. At the Moscow campus, there will be a watch party from 9 am to noon on the Idaho Commons Plaza. Whether your traveling or staying home, stay safe in finding your spot to watch the eclipse.</p><p>Also as the semester begins, be sure to stop by the Library to find your study spot. With our new comfy furniture and expanded computer labs, there are plenty of choices!</p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="2699" data-orig-width="1857"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/164448081009_1.jpg" data-orig-height="2699" data-orig-width="1857"/></figure><blockquote class="bg-light pt-1 px-4 font-italic"><p>Top photo: MG 233 Earl Junior Larrison Papers, 1915-1987, eclipse of the sun, 1970.
