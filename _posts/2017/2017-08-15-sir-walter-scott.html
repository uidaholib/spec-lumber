<p>Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) was an historical novelist,
playwright, poet, and politically active proud son of Scotland. Scott is the
author of <i>Rob Roy, Ivanhoe, </i>and <i>Waverly </i>as well as the poem <i>The Lady of the Lake </i>among other
literary classics. In an 1832 publication of letters written by Scott to Rev. R.
Polwhele concerning a move of residence Scott wrote "<i>I leave to my better half the care of furniture and china, yet there
are such things as books and papers, not to mention broad swords, targets, battle-axes
and helmuts, guns, pistols and dirks the care of which devolved upon meâ€¦" </i>This
first edition volume of letters is one of over 1200 books either written by or
about Sir Walter Scott in Special Collections. The Scott collection was started
in 1962 with a donation of first editions from Earl Larrison, a professor of
Zoology at the University of Idaho. This oil painting of Sir Walter Scott was
commissioned by Dr. Larrison , painted by artist Gregory A. Pole and donated to
Special Collections.</p><figure data-orig-width="359" data-orig-height="567" class="tmblr-full mb-5"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/harvester/tumblr/164216304299_0.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="359" data-orig-height="567"/></figure>
