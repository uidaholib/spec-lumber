UI Library newspaper section, then and now, from shortly after the building opened 60 years ago this month, to the newspaper storage area today. All historical Idaho newspapers have now been transferred to microfilm, rather than what looks like bound up in neat packages, while the current and previous monthsâ€™ papers are still available for patrons to browse.
