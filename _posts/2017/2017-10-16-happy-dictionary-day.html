<p>Today <i>Cover to Cover</i>
looks at <i>the Cyclopaedia of Costume or
Dictionary of Dress </i>written by James Planché from 1876-1879 and part of the
University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives rare book
collection. Planché was a playwright but became known as an expert on
historical costume after researching costumes for productions of stage plays. The
dictionary uses a variety of methods for illustrating the historical types of
dress it describes including reproductions of well-known paintings and a
variety of illustrations. The illustration included in the front cover is a
portrait from the mid 1390’s of the English king Richard II, shown below, the
earliest known portrait of an English monarch.</p><figure data-orig-width="1158" data-orig-height="1840" class="tmblr-full mb-5"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/166469790262_0.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1158" data-orig-height="1840"/></figure><p>The full title of Planché ‘s two volume work is <i>A cyclopdiea of costume, or a dictionary of
