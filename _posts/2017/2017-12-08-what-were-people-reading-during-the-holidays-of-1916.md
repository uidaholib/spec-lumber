What were people reading during the holidays in 1916? University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives thinks *The Romance of a Christmas Card*, published that year, is one possibility. The copy of this title included in our book collections was written by Katie Douglas Smith Wiggin, educator and
author of the children’s classic *Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm*. The story tells the tale of two separate Christmas cards written by a vicar’s wife and the impact each card has in the
life of the recipient.
