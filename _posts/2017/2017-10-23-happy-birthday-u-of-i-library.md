Today’s the day! It’s our building’s 60th birthday! The University of Idaho Library opened the doors of it’s brand new building on October 23, 1957. 

At the time of its completion, the library was one of the
largest buildings on the campus at 205 feet long, 138 feet wide and 89,606
total square feet. It cost approximately $1.3 million to build. The new
structure marked a significant milestone as the library had been housed in the
U of I Administration Building since 1892.
