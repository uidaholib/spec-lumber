The University of Idaho Library is celebrating 60 years in its own building this month. Before 1957, the Library was housed in the Administration Building for more than 5 decades. Why did the Library need its own building? Overcrowding was one reason!

As this photo of the main reading room taken in 1934 shows, space was at a premium in the Library in it’s Administration building location. In the new Library building there was seating space for over 1,000 readers at a time! The University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives is exhibiting materials related to the Library’s history and building anniversary in displays on the 1st and 2nd floor. Come take a look.
