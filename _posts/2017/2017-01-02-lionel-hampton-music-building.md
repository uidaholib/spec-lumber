Built in 1950, the Music Building holds music classrooms, an auditorium, faculty offices, a library, and rehearsal rooms. Renamed in 1987 as the Lionel Hampton Music Building, home to the also then renamed Lionel Hampton School of Music, in honor of jazz musician Lionel Hampton and his newly formed affiliation with the University of Idaho International Jazz Festival.
