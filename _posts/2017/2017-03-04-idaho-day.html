The 2017 theme is “Idaho the Beautiful.”


For the University of Idaho Library Special Collections contribution, we are posting postcard images of the beautiful Palouse, with its rolling wheat fields and surrounding gentle mountains. <br/></p><p><a href="http://www.idahoday.org/">Idaho Day</a>; “Picturesque Palouse” by photographer Hendrik Juve, PG 9-16-02a, <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/postcards/index.html">Northwest Historical Postcard Collection</a>, Digital Initiatives, University of Idaho Library.</p>
