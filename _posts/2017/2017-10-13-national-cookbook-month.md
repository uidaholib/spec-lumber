In celebration of Octoberâ€™s designation as National Cookbook Month we are featuring *Favorite Recipes of Moscow Ladies* published in 1896. The book is part of the Day-Northwest Collection found in the University of
Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives. For Fall, we thought a couple of nice soup recipes would be just the thing.

The cookbook contains recipes from members of the Ladies Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Moscow, Idaho. The front cover declared it was a cook book "containing the choicest recipes for economical and
practical housekeeping. 

Another cookbook found in the Day-Northwest Collection
is *Choice Recipes* published in 1931
by the Hospitality Committee of the Presbyterian Ladies Aid of the Presbyterian Church in Moscow. This cookbook also offers some warm, filling soup recipes.
