June 9 is International Archives Day with a theme of *Archives, Citizenship and Interculturalism*. In recognition of this day, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives highlights our collection of 4-H club materials. A program founded more than a 100 years ago, 4-H currently reaches more than 7 million young people in more than 50 countries. While the bulk of the programs are managed through Cooperate Extension at land-grant universities in the United States such as the University of Idaho there are also independent 4-H programs being implemented on a global scale.[^1]

Through the years the objective of 4-H, nationally and internationally, has remained the same; development of youth as individuals and as responsible and productive citizens. This is demonstrated, for example, through the leadership opportunities offered through statewide and national gatherings called the 4-H Congress.
