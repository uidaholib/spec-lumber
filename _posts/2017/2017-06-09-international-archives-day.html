<p>June 9 is International Archives Day with a theme of <i>Archives, Citizenship and Interculturalism. </i> In recognition of this day, University of
Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives highlights our collection of 4-H
club materials. A program founded more than a 100 years ago, 4-H currently reaches
more than 7 million young people in more than 50 countries. While the bulk of
the programs are managed through Cooperate Extension at land-grant universities
in the United States such as the University of Idaho there are also independent
4-H programs being implemented on a global scale* </p><p>The clover symbol with the H on each leaf is the symbol of
