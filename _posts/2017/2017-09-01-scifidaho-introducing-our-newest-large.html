 <p>#scifidaho Introducing our newest large collection! This summer, Special Collections received a large personal collection of science fiction materials owned by University of Idaho alumna and long-time Moscow, ID resident Victoria (Vicki) E. Mitchell. </p>
 <p>Mitchell (along with her soon-to-be husband Jon Gustafson) was a member of the Palouse Empire Science Fiction Association (PESFA) and a 1978 founding member of MosCon, the annual science fiction convention in Moscow. Vicki organized MosCon for over 20 years and was also a member of local writing groups and workshops including Writer’s Bloc and the Moscow Moffia Writers’ Program. She published several science fiction works, won a national story contest, and her first novel, <i>Enemy Unseen: A Star Trek Novel</i>, spent three weeks on the New York Times Bestseller list in 1990. Mitchell worked as a staff geologist for the Idaho Geological Survey for many years and won the Idaho State Historical Society Esto Perpetua award for promoting and preserving Idaho history in 2006.</p>
 <p>As we begin to go through the collection, we will be posting some of our favorite book covers. To start off, here are some Star Trek titles by Vicki Mitchell published in different languages that we had found and had already in our collections. Stay tuned for more!</p>
