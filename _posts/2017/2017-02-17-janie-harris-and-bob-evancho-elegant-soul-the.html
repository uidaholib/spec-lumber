 <p> Janie Harris and Bob Evancho, <i>Elegant SOUL: The Life and Music of Gene Harris,</i> (Caldwell, Idaho: Caxton Press, 2005). <br></p>
 <p>Weâ€™re pretty excited that next week is our 50th anniversary of the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival! To help celebrate, University of Idaho Library Special Collections has put together exhibits and events all across campus and the town of Moscow. More about these next week. </p>
 <p>Considering we have been living all things jazz for the last few weeks, here is a Caxton cover celebrating jazz pianist Gene Harris. This deviates a bit from the #FullCaxtonJacket series, since it is a paperback, but it is still in line with the vibrant and dynamic Caxton covers.</p>
