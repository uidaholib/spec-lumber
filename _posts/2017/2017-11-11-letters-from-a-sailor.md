Letters from A Sailor by Daniel E. Lee contains letters between University of Idaho student Conrad Ostroot and his Moscow, Idaho family. Ostroot enlisted in the United States Navy in December 1917, just days before his twentieth birthday. The letters provide a glimpse into his life as he trains and prepares for deployment during World War I.
