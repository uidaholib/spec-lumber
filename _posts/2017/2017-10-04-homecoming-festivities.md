Happy Homecoming Vandals!

You’re halfway through the week and I hope you’re all gearing up to participate in the upcoming festivities! Did you know that many homecoming events have been long time honored traditions? Cheer competitions, parade floats, serpentine, bonfires, fireworks, halftime shows, and more have been part of University of Idaho history for many generations.
