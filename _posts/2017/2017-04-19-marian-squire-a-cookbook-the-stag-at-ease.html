 <p>Marian Squire, <i>A Cookbook; the Stag at Ease,</i> (Caldwell, Id.: Caxton Printers, 1938). <br></p>
 <p>Incidentally, FDR’s favorite dish is ‘Eggs President,’ (scrambled eggs): 1 tablespoon butter, 6 eggs, 3 tablespoons milk, cream, or water. Melt the butter in a skillet. Have eggs beaten just enough so that white and yellow are blended. Add liquid. Pour into hot butter and stir over fire until the desired consistency has been reached.</p>
