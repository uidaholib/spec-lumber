Last week, we learned about using the powerful forces of water to transport logs from a central point to the lumber mill. This week is light reading - trains were one of the most popular methods of transporting logs to lumbers, as they could transport large quantities of logs relatively easily, as seen in these images.

That’s it for this week! Stay tuned for next week’s Logging Lesson where we’ll discuss the final product in logging: usable lumber!
