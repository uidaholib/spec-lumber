This image brings up so many questions, and yet the only information we have is ‘Mrs. Murphy – copy of a photo of a woman sitting on a man’s lap, 190?’

Is the woman Mrs. Murphy?

I’m guessing the person in the tuxedo is not Mr. Murphy…?

Where are they?

Is that a bicycle in the background?

Perhaps we will never learn the story behind this unusual photograph.
