According to [www.thefreedictionary.com](http://www.thefreedictionary.com), "scripophily" is ‘the hobby of collecting bonds and share certificates, esp those of historical interest,’ such as the one as seen above for the Standard Dairy Company of Wallace, Idaho.  The Standard Dairy Company was incorporated on December 27, 1920 and existed as such until December of 1938 when Edward Gentry, then President and sole shareholder, and the remaining business partners decided to part ways.
