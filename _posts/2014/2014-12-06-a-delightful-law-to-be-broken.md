December 5, 1933, 81 years ago today, America ratified the 21st amendment once again legalizing alcohol.  The 18th amendment, prohibiting the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within the United States, originally passed in 1919 with the best of intentions to improve society and home life, but quickly spiraled out of control.  Underground manufacture and sale of liquor went rampant, and the lawlessness actually increased.

Many breweries went out of business, with the exception of the large corporations that were able to "dealcoholize" their product, thus conforming to the law.

It didn’t take long for drinking to once again become socially acceptable in most places.  The first advertisement for "good drink" appeared about a month after the repeal in University of Idaho student newspaper The Argonaut.

Happy Repeal Day!
