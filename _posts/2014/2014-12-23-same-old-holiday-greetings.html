<p>This 1933 Holiday Greeting served as card and envelope all in one.  When it is folded into quarters then sealed with a flap on one side, it was able to be sent through the mail.  The delightful depiction of campus was sent by Jesse and Leah Buchanan.  Jesse was the first student to maintain a 4.0 grade point average during his four years as an undergraduate when he graduated from UI in 1927, and went on to become president of the University of Idaho from 1946-1954.</p>
