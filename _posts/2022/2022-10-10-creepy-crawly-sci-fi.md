For some, October is a spook-tacular month. Some choose to watch classic horror films, and some choose to gorge on candy after trick-or-treating. 

Some even do both. 

But then there are folks out there who celebrate the macabre all year round by reading something truly horrifying: Science Fiction novels.

Did you know U of I Library Special Collections and Archives contains a vast amount of Sci-Fi novels and paraphernalia? Our Victoria E. Mitchell Collection on Science Fiction houses more than two hundred boxes filled to the brim with books kept by Mitchell. Below are some of our favorite creepy covers.
