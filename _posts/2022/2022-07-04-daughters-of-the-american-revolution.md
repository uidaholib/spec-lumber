On October 11, 1890, the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) was founded. They had three simple objectives: to perpetuate the memory and spirit of the men and women who achieved American independence; to promote institutions for the dispersal of knowledge to the public; and to cherish, maintain, and extend intuitions of American freedom.

According to *History and Register, Idaho State Society, Daughters of the American Revolution*, the first Idaho residential member was Mary Gridley Tarr. She had moved to Teton Basin, Idaho in 1902, and was elected as the Idaho's DAR Organizing Regent at the 1904 Continental Congress.

From its establishment in Idaho, membership and participation grew. Many members came from well-known families who most often traced their ancestry back to the colonial period. One such member was Jennie O. Lawwill, leader of the Caldwell chapter and supposed descendent of Amonute (commonly known by her nickname, Pocahontas).
