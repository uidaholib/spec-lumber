The Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival is here! This year, the Jazz Fest exhibit features materials from the UI Library's [Collection on Ella Fitzgerald](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv28439). It includes a beautiful gown worn by Fitzgerald, her aquamarine satin pumps, her pillpox hat, and much more!
