In 1892, seven wives of University of Idaho faculty members gathered together in the home of Jennie Gault with one thing in mind: book club. 

This group met once a week to read books, discuss literature, and have companionship with fellow wives of campus. The beginning members included Jennie Gault, Kate Henderson, Sara Ostrander, Ellen Aldrich, Millicent Bonebright, Martha Fox, and C. W. McCurdy.

# Pleiades, or the "Seven Sisters"

It is said the group got their namesake after a conversation with Franklin Gault, President of the university from 1892 to 1898. He compared the seven wives to the seven stars in the Pleiades constellation. Also known as the "Seven Sisters", Greek mythology says these stars are the seven daughters of the Titan god Atlas and the ocean nymph Pleione. Though the number of women in this group eventually rose to more than seven, the name stuck.

# First Federated Women's Club

The first act of the Pleiades Club was to commission an item to be on display at the Idaho exhibition during the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, IL. The Gold and Silver Book was suggested by Jennie Gault, designed by Annette Bowman, and forged by Tiffany & Co. of New York. Made from Idaho gold, silver, and semi-precious stones, it survived the 1906 fire which destroyed the old administration building.

On March 1, 1894, the Pleiades Club was formally organized and adopted a constitution. Then in 1895, it joined the General Federation of Women's Clubs. Mary E. Forney, former member of Pleiades, said the club was the oldest federated club in the state in continuous existence.
