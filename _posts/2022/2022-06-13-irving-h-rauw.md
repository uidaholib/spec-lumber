Like many men and women of the time, Irving joined the United States Army in World War Two. Serving as an Army pilot, he was sent to Greenland, England, North Africa, and Italy. The airplane Irving flew was the Oregon B-26 Marauder, and was named the Repulsive Wabbit. His military career included participation in bombing raids over Lampedusa, Pantelleria, Sicily, Sardinia, and Rome. After the war, Irving became a coordinator for combat returnees.
