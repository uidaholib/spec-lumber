As I previously mentioned in my last blog post, "Why Women in Natural Resources," I wanted to know two things about the *Women in Natural Resources* collection:

1. Why was this journal created?
2. Who were these women?

Fortunately, as the plethora of documents found their new homes in acid-free folders and boxes, their contents began to piece together the answers. A story slowly formed - one about capable women. Women who wanted to to pursue their passions. Those passions happened to be within the male-dominated fields of Natural Resources: unfamiliar career-territory for women in the 1970s. But, like the intrepid explorers they are, these women pushed onward and were met with a wide-range of reactions from their male colleagues: some extremely supportive, others dismissive, and some - adversarial. 

You wouldn't initially guess that behind the smiling faces and confident eyes of these diverse women lurked frustrations, struggles and hardships. While some, like Dixie Ehrenreich (managing editor of *WiNR*, 1983-1999), Molly Stock (contributing editor of *WiNR*, 1983-1987) and Jo Ellen Force (public relations for *WiNR*, 1980s) vocally expressed and shared their experiences through the journal, others, like Lauren Fins (Professor of Forest Genetics at U of I) marched stoically and silently toward their goals. Different women took different paths to similar destinations, and yet all of these women weave into the fabric of the *WiNR* Collection's history. As Dixie, Molly, and Jo Ellen have expressed, the journal was born out of a necessity to find solidarity with other women professionals in the male-dominated Forestry field. Initially, the journal began as a newsletter called *Women in Forestry*

but over time, it grew to encompass professionals in forestry, wildlife, range, fisheries, recreation, and related fields, changing its name to *Women in Natural Resources*.

From its fruition to its end, this publication aimed to serve as a supportive community for women in Natural Resources fields. 

What stood out among letters of correspondence and submissions were photographs and personal stories of the women themselves. I found that these pictures could speak a thousand words - better than what I could fit into multiple blog posts - and they also show the wide range of successful careers that these women pursued.

Below are only ten materials from our digital collection:

About a submission to the *WiNR* journal a female Hotshot's experience with firefighting in Yellowstone National Park.
