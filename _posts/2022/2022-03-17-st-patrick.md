We are celebrating this St. Patrick's Day by reading <i>Irish Poets and Poetry of the Nineteenth Century</i> by Oscar Wilde.

Oscar Wilde, or Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde, is considered to be one of the most recognized Irish authors and poets in literature. His play <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> (1895) is a classic of theater comedy. Wilde went on to write fairy tales, poems, critical essays, and one novel.
