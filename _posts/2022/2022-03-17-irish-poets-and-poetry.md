We are celebrating this St. Patrick's Day by reading <i>Irish Poets and Poetry of the Nineteenth Century</i> by Oscar Wilde.



Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde, was born in Dublin, Ireland on October 16, 1854. Wilde was a well known Irish author, poet, and play-wright during the late nineteenth century. This book features parts of a transcribed lecture Wilde gave while on tour in San Francisco, California. 



Oscar Wilde died on November 30, 1900 at only 46 years old. His influence on literature is felt to this day.
