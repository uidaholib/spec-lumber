The Gehring's were among the first consignors in the first Lewiston Hereford Sale. Their bull, Perfect Alan, won Champion at the Grange Livestock Pavilion in East Lewiston. In the early years of the Lewiston show, the average price for bulls was one hundred dollars while top steers were sold at four cents per pound.
