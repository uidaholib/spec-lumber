 <p>Today, we remember President George H.W. Bush. President Bush had a longtime relationship with the Lionel Hampton. These pictures from our Lionel Hampton Library Collection show President Bush and Lionel, one when the President was Vice-President, and one when Lionel performed at the President’s Inaugaral Ball.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“<i>Lionel was a dear friend of Barbara’s and mine for over forty years. Lionel Hampton was a national treasure. His career represents the very heart and soul of America’s jazz. That heritage is something we as a nation need to preserve and cherish for generations to come</i>.” - President George H.W. Bush<br></p>
