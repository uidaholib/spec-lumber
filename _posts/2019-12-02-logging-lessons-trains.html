Last week, we learned about using the powerful forces of water to transport logs from a central point to the lumber mill. This week is light reading - trains were one of the most popular methods of transporting logs to lumbers, as they could transport large quantities of logs relatively easily, as seen in these images.</p><p>That’s it for this week! Stay tuned for next week’s Logging Lesson where we’ll discuss the final product in logging: usable lumber!</p><figure data-orig-width="1353" data-orig-height="697" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/189434258829_1.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1353" data-orig-height="697"/></figure><p>Photos courtesy of Potlatch Historical Society.</p>
