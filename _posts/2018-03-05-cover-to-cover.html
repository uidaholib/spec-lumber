<p>March 4<sup>th</sup> marked Idaho Day with festivities to
honor the day occurring today at the Idaho Statehouse in Boise. Commemorating
the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the end of World War I the theme for the
event this year is Idaho Remembers. University of Idaho Library Special
Collections and Archives remembers Thomas Croft Neibaur, a WWI soldier from Idaho who
received the Medal of Honor. A book on Neibaur’s life is found in the Day NW
Collections. <i>Place The Headstones Where
They Belong</i> by Sherman L. Fleek chronicles Neibaur’s war story as well as
his life after the end of WWI. Neibaur was awarded the Medal of Honor in a
ceremony in France in February of 1919. 
Below is a studio portrait of Private Neibaur wearing his Medal of Honor
and other decorations.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1695" data-orig-width="1123"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/171557797363_0.jpg" data-orig-height="1695" data-orig-width="1123"/></figure><p>The Citation read at the time of his award indicates:</p><p><i>On the afternoon of 16
October 1918, when the Cote-de-Chatillion had just been gained after bitter
fighting and the summit of that strong bulwark in the Kriemhilde Stellung was
being organized, Pvt. Neibaur was sent out on patrol with his automatic rifle
squad to enfilade enemy machinegun nests. As he gained the ridge he set up his
automatic rifle and was directly thereafter wounded in both legs by fire from a
hostile machine gun on his flank. The advance wave of the enemy troops,
counterattacking, had about gained the ridge, and although practically cut off
and surrounded, the remainder of his detachment being killed or wounded, this
gallant soldier kept his automatic rifle in operation to such effect that by
his own efforts and by fire from the skirmish line of his company, at least 100
yards in his rear, the attack was checked. The enemy wave being halted and
Iying prone, 4 of the enemy attacked Pvt. Neibaur at close quarters. These he
killed. He then moved alone among the enemy Iying on the ground about him, in
the midst of the fire from his own lines, and by coolness and gallantry captured
11 prisoners at the point of his pistol and, although painfully wounded,
brought them back to our lines. The counterattack in full force was arrested to
a large extent by the single efforts of this soldier, whose heroic exploits
took place against the skyline in full view of his entire battalion.</i></p><p>In addition to the Medal of Honor, Neibaur was awarded a Purple Heart and a WWI Medal in Victory as well as medals and honors from Italy, France and Belgium.
