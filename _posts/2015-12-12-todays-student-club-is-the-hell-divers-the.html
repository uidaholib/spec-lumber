 <p>Today’s student club is the Hell Divers, the University of Idaho Swimming Honorary.</p>
 <p>For around forty years on the University of Idaho Campus, the Hell Divers’ Club was composed of members, both men and women, who had passed the senior life-saving tests of the American Red Cross.&nbsp; The club was the UI Chapter of the American Red Cross Life-saving Corps, organized on the campus in October 1930.&nbsp; The work of the organization included furthering active interest and participation in swimming and water safety, to recognize swimming ability and to foster true sportsmanship.&nbsp; <br></p>
