America, America, Smog smears its grays on thee; We stain thy prime with soot and grime And strontium ninety!</p><p><b>Verse 2:</b> O beautiful for strip-mine pit Where once the laurel bloomed; For brooklets running sulphur-stained And rotten egg perfumed. America, America, On bureaucrats cry shame; For canyons dammed and us flim-flamm'd in Reclamation's name!</p><p><b>Verse 3: </b>O beautiful for scenery Black'd out by billboard's span; For nauseous stick of sew'rs we drink Where once pure rivers ran. America, America, What thieves thy people be, Who rob from earth their children's birth-Right, Nature's legacy!</p><p><b>Verse 4: </b>O beaitufl for neon sign By big-dam power lit; For carrion of countless cars On hillside charnel pit. America, America, Whom ev'ry gully robs; Thy landscape slopped with litter dropped By (let us face it) slobs!</p><p><b>Verse 5:</b> O beautiful for highways broad, With beer cans tightly hemm'd; For marshes drained and dollars gained And water-fowl condemn'd. America, America, God grant us sanity; With wealth we're blest, yet foul our nest And then chop down the tree!</p><p>Photo courtesy of Folder 9, MG 478 (<a href="https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv707396/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&amp;q=">Tom Kovalicky Papers</a>), University of Idaho Library, Special Collections &amp; Archives, Moscow, Idaho.</p>
