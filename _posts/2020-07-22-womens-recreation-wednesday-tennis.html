<p>Welcome back to another week of Women’s Recreation
Wednesday, our series covering the Women’s Recreation Association here at the
University of Idaho.</p><p>This week features photos of women playing tennis.
“Today, tennis is a major international sport and a multi-billion dollar
industry – and it’s also one of the few sports in which the earning potential
of male and female athletes is totally equal.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>However, it took a long time for equality to be achieved.
Tennis first emerged in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century as lawn tennis “after a
British major and a Spanish merchant combined aspects of the British game
rackets and the Spanish game pelota…The two opened the first tennis club in
1874….Even back in 1874, women were still playing mixed doubles.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[2]</a>
Wimbledon was founded in 1877 as a fundraiser and “the first Ladies’
Championship at the tournament was held in 1884.”<a href="#_ftn2" title="">[3]</a></p><p>Tennis, however, “remained a highly segregated sport well
into the 20<sup>th</sup> century.” “The first African American player to break
into tennis was Althea Gibson…who became the first person of color to win a
Grand Slam when she won the French Open in 1956.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[4]</a></p><p>Wimbledon “became the last Grand Slam to equalize…prize
money” between men and women in 2007. “The change was thanks in large part to
pressure from both the WTA and tennis stars, especially Venus Williams…”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[5]</a></p><p>Stay tuned for next week’s installment of Women’s
Recreation Wednesday, where we’ll talk about track and field!</p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="867" data-orig-width="1322"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/624353735820361728_0.jpg" data-orig-height="867" data-orig-width="1322"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="1251" data-orig-width="862"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/624353735820361728_1.jpg" data-orig-height="1251" data-orig-width="862"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="1262" data-orig-width="907"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/624353735820361728_2.jpg" data-orig-height="1262" data-orig-width="907"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="1238" data-orig-width="1873"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/624353735820361728_3.jpg" data-orig-height="1238" data-orig-width="1873"/></figure><p>Photos courtesy of <a href="http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv152953/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&amp;q=">UG
