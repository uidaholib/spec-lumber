While I never took any chemistry classes, I will always remember him playing the role of Professor Dumbledore during a chemistry demonstration held in the U of I Library in conjunction with the U.S. National Library of Medicine’s Renaissance Science, Magic and Medicine in Harry Potter’s World traveling exhibit. </p><p>From the press release: “It is with great
sadness that we share with you the death of Tom Bitterwolf, a professor of
chemistry in the College of Science. Tom has been a faculty member at the
University of Idaho since 1988. Tom was
on the faculty of the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis prior to coming
to the U of I and is a Navy veteran. He was an organometallic chemist with
incredible skill in mentoring and engaging students. Tom was
named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in
2014 and was the inaugural recipient of the College of Science Dyess Faculty
Fellowship. He received many university awards for excellence over the years. Tom was
also deeply involved in the Boy Scouts. Please keep his wife and daughters in
your thoughts during this time.”</p><blockquote><p>Photos from U of I Library staff. </p></blockquote>
