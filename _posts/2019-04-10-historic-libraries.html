Originally, a shelf of books at Lewiston City Hall in Lewiston, Idaho, the city library has changed greatly over the years. In 1901, the Tsceminicum Club applied for a Carnegie grant, receiving $10,000. This Carnegie Library was opened in 1903 and served patrons until 1999. The library has since moved to another location, but we still love it just as much.   (PG 5-007-3h)</p>
