Happy National Ag Day! If you have a chance, stop by the first floor of the UI Library and check out the exhibit celebrating Idaho’s contribution to feeding the world. National Ag Week, and National Ag Day were first commemorated in 1973 by the Agriculture Council of America to promote the vital role of agriculture in society.
