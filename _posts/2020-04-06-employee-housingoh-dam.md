Welcome back to another week of Oh Dam!, our series
on dams in the Pacific Northwest.

Ever wonder where dam construction workers live while
these dams are being built? These photos show employee housing around the Grand
Coulee Dam. The majority of homes were 2-bedroom and 3-bedroom permanent type
residences.
