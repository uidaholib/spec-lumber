Originally formed to compete in both downhill and jumping, the team now competes in three disciplines: Slalom, Giant Slalom and Dual Slalom. In 1949, one member of the team, Sverre Kongsgaard, a Norwegian
exchange student, attracted national attention when
he broke the North American ski jumping record on Olympian
Hill at Hyak, Washington with a jump of 290 feet. The old
distance of 289 feet was set by the late Torger Tokle, also of
Norway. Kongsgaard's comment was, &ldquo;I made a good jump. It
may never happen again.&quot;Â <br/></p><blockquote><p>PG 2_165-2 Sverre Kongsgaard,
