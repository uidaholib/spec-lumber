Through October 3, 2025, the Smithsonian traveling exhibition "Voices and Votes: Democracy in America" is on display in the University of Idaho Library. The Latah County Historical Society collaborated with the U of I Library, the Idaho Humanities Council, and the League of Women Voters to ship and install the exhibition, one of several events taking place in Idaho throughout 2025-2026 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of America's founding (America250).[^1] The exhibition, part of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service, is based on the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History exhibition "American Democracy: A Great Leap of Faith".[^2]

Per the Smithsonian, "Voices and Votes" seeks to spark discussions about the questions "who has the right to vote, what are the freedoms and responsibilities of citizens, and whose voices will be heard?"[^3] Through images, documents, videos, and interactive elements such as short games, the exhibition illustrates the history of democracy in America from the revolutionary era to the present. "Voices and Votes" also prompts visitors to consider their own place in democracy, addressing issues such as voting rights, petitioning, and protest.

The exhibition consists of six units that explore significant eras and debates in the story of democracy in America. Visitors are encouraged to start by viewing the installations on the first floor of the University of Idaho Library and then proceed to the rest of the exhibition on the second floor.

On display in the U of I Library alongside "Voices and Votes" are materials with more local connections. The Latah County Historical Society has contributed flyers and other ephemera from local elections over the decades. A selection of political buttons, part of U of I Special Collections and Archives' [Political Buttons and Stickers collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv574318), can be found on the southern wall of the second floor exhibit area.
