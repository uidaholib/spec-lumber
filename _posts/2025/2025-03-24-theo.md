Donald R. Theophilus (1899-1970) was university president from 1954-1965 and a member of its faculty for nearly 40 years. When he passed away his successor, University President Ernest W. Hartung, remarked that "Idaho has lost a distinguished and loved educator, who gave great and dedicated service to the University of Idaho and the state (*Argonaut* 1970)."

The University of Idaho Library Special Collections & Archives holds some of his speeches as well reports detailing with significant developments during his presidency, including academic, financial, and infrastructural growth. Newspaper clippings capture moments of his leadership, covering key events, speeches, and the university's involvement in agricultural education and research.

During his service as president, the University of Idaho saw one of its largest rises in enrollment. He also instituted adult education programs throughout the state.  Reporting on the president emeritus' passing, the *Argonaut* quoted Kenneth A. Dick, then financial vice president of the university, that due to Theophilus' efforts "major progress has been made in appropriations, salary rates, benefits, size of faculty, research activities, buildings, off-campus influence, and enrollments."

Theophilus also oversaw the construction of some of the University's largest buildings, including the Library, the Wallace Residential Center, and an addition to the Student Union (now the Bruce Pitman Center.) Upon completion, the new high-rise dormitory was named in his honor in 1969.

He was a popular orator and invited to give addresses not only for the Idaho commencement ceremony but at other universities. He looked on the University's land-grant mission as a serious and worthy endeavor. Writing for the *Idahonian*'s 50th anniversary, he pronounced: "The future of the University of Idaho rests with the people of Idaho implemented by intelligent, coordinated, aggressive, articulate efforts of faculty, students and administration working together and always keeping in mind that "the future belongs to those who plan for it." As Theophilus attened in the 1964 University Presidents Meeting in Washington D.C. White House Meeting of the Presidents of State Universities

At the University's 75th Founders Day celebration, he reminded the audience: "The dreams of our founders, the dreams of our predecessors have become our traditions, and we must review these traditions in light of the advance of technology, increased social consciousness, increased personal and national responsibilities., in order to dream again."
