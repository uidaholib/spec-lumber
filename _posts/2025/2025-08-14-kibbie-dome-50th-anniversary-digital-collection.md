[The Kibbie Dome 50th Anniversary Digital Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/kibbiedome/) was developed in recognition of the P1FCU Kibbie Dome’s 50th anniversary in 2025. It presents a selection of images and documents from the archival collections of the University of Idaho Library’s Special Collections and Archives, with a special emphasis on the Kibbie Dome’s formative era in the mid-1970s. The events and subjects represented in this digital collection reflect the history of the Kibbie Dome and some of its predecessor sports facilities on the University of Idaho campus.

All but a few of these historical images and documents were newly digitized for this collection. This curated selection showcases the Kibbie Dome’s half-century history through the lens of the University of Idaho’s archival collections, reflecting the rich and serendipitous nature of historical documentation. The building’s history is illustrated by different kinds of archival materials that capture the spirit and activities of their respective eras.

Featured moments include the construction of the Kibbie Dome during the summer of 1975 and its dedication in October of that year. The construction of the stadium was heavily documented by local news outlets, various university units, and members of the community. The dedication ceremony, which took place during halftime of the 1975 Homecoming football game, featured speeches by University President Ernest Hartung and Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus, in addition to benefactor William H. Kibbie.

As a multipurpose facility with a large capacity, particularly in relation to the size of the Moscow community, the Kibbie Dome has also been the natural choice for other kinds of large-scale gatherings over the years, as illustrated in this digital collection. These include musical concerts, home and auto shows, circus performances, graduation ceremonies, and much more.
