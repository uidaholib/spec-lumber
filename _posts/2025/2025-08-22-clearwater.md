Archiving the Visual History of the Nez Perce -- Clearwater National Forest
The Nez Perce -- Clearwater National Forest photograph collection captures nearly a century of history on thousands of photographic prints. This collection encapsulates the joint history of the Clearwater and Nez Perce forests, which were established nationally in 1907 and 1908, respectively, and administratively combined in 2012. In 2024, this collection was transferred to the University of Idaho from the Forest Service to be processed and stored. Over 15,000 photographic prints document forest service activities, beginning in the early 1900s and stretching into the 1990s, thus providing a fascinating look into the history, development, and management of the Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forests.

Predominantly taken by rangers and other forest service employees, these photographs document various elements related to the everyday management of a national forest. Many photographs capture the natural beauty of the forest landscape, from the forests themselves to hills, mountains, bodies of water, and plains, all lovingly documented by rangers of the 20th century. These prints also showcase the diverse flora and fauna that fill the forest, not only trees but also the insects, birds, fish, and mammals that call this forest home.

But wildlife isn't the only faunal presence in these photographs. Plenty of companion animals -- particularly dogs and horses, as well as other equines such as mules and donkeys -- are depicted alongside their owners, friends, and fellow employees (and the occasional bear cub). These animals, especially horses and mules, played an important role in the early management of the national forest by providing transportation and packing gear across rough landscapes . Despite how many horses and dogs documented in the collection, however, very few are ever named. Photograph P00926 is one of the only photographs in the processed extent of the collection that provides a name for the animals shown in it: Blackie (L) and Silver (R).

 	The collection also includes documentation of the important, nitty-gritty elements of serving in the Forest Service. Many photographs reveal the day-to-day work involved with fire management, fire lookouts in particular, as well as logging and timber management, range management, and even construction of roads, trails, and buildings throughout the forest.

As would be expected for a National Forest, recreational activities are present across the collection. Forest employees took care to document their off time, as they participated in hunting, fishing, and general camaraderie in the beautiful vistas in which they got to live and work. Some of the most engaging photographs in this collection are those rangers and other employees took of one another, whether those be of retirement parties, individual portraits, or simply documenting time together.

On occasion, photographs in this collection document history outside of or not directly related to the Nez Perce or Clearwater National Forests. Alongside management of the forest itself, the Forest Service also plays a role in the management of cultural resources. Whether that be archaeological sites, historical buildings, or cultural activities, forest rangers had a hand in documenting and caring for such resources.

The Nez Perce -- Clearwater National Forest photograph collection provides a fascinating look into a century of Idaho's history, capturing the development and management of national forests throughout the 20th century. The physical and temporal breadth of this collection certainly makes it a valuable resource for historians and casual  researchers alike.
