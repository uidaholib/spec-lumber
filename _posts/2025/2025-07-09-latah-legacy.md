The University of Idaho Library has long been a partner with the [Latah County Historical Society (LCHS)](https://www.latahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/), hosting various LCHS collections for public access.
One of the most popular is a selection of the [LCHS Oral History Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/lcoh/) with interviews done in the 1970s. 
We are pleased to announce another collection housed on the Library Digital Collections website: the [Latah Legacy Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahlegacy/)!

The Latah Legacy is an annual journal published by LCHS dating back to 1972. 
The Legacies contain local history articles written by LCHS staff, community members, and scholars.

For example, the [2023 edition](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahlegacy/items/latahlegacy_v50-n1.html) contained articles by the University of Idaho public archaeology team about the Moscow High School dig and Rebecca Scofield wrote about early efforts to establish universal kindergartens across the state. 
Robert Lee Sappington researched a Japanese WWII balloon that landed in Latah County, Ariana Burns looked at the history of Talisman House, and Nancy Ruth Peterson included an excerpt of her history of Emmanuel Lutheran Church.

One of the most unique features was written by MFA Theatre student and LCHS volunteer Jantzen Bates about a collection of handmade paper dolls created by Elaine Meyer, donated to LCHS. These paper dolls were highly detailed and depicted film and comic book fashions from the 1930s and 40s. Bates researched the inspirations for these fashions and digitized all the outfits and accessories. Her article explores both fashion history and what life might have been like in the 1930s for Elaine Meyer. Its a fascinating look at adolescence during the Depression and the creativity and talent of one girl who entertained herself with these handmade dolls. 

These are just a few examples of what you will find in the Latah Legacy collection. Some of the history is well-known, while other articles examine lesser-known community stories or book reviews. Throughout the collection you will find well-researched, and quality work of historians, all about our shared community.
