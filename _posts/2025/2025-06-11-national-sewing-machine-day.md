June 13 marks National Sewing Machine Day, a celebration of one of the most transformative inventions in textile history. The sewing machine revolutionized how we create clothing, textiles, and other fabric goods, making it possible to create more complex and intricate clothing patterns and stitches at a scale and speed not possible with hand-sewing.

At the University of Idaho, sewing and textile education have long played a meaningful role in our history. From early Home Economics courses to Extension publications now housed in Special Collections and Archives, sewing has proven to be a foundational skill for generations of Vandals.

The University of Idaho's School of Family and Consumer Sciences, previously known as the Home Economics department, has a rich legacy shaped by pioneering educators such as Margaret Ritchie and Mary Hall Niccolls. Margaret Ritchie was head of the department for a number of years before retiring and continuing to teach classes, showing her dedication to the university's home economics program.

Today, the Margaret Ritchie School of Family and Consumer Sciences offers undergraduate programs in apparel, textiles and design, child development, early childhood education, family and consumer sciences, food and nutrition, human development and family studies, nutritional sciences and FCS teacher education.

Another important figure from the School of Family and Consumer Science is Leila Old. The Leila Old Historic Costume Collection, housed in the Hays building on campus. This vast collection includes costumes and clothing from over a century of the University's history:

"The Leila Old Historic Costume Collection, gathered from residents of Inland Northwest, alumni and friends of the university, reflects the clothing across lower, middle and upper class society in Idaho, in good times and bad, from around 1850 to the present.

Approximately 18,000 items are represented in the collection dating from the Civil War to the present time and a 8,000 plus lace collection donated by Kathleen Warnick and others. A majority of our pieces are related to Idaho and our university."

Dozens of University of Idaho Extension publications have been published that relate to sewing, patterns, costume-making, and other textile skills. From patterns, to basic information about sewing machine maintenance, these publications have highlighted the importance and practicality of sewing and the impact of sewing machines on the textile industry. Not only has the sewing machine made sewing clothes and other materials faster, it has also changed how people spend their time and money.

Beyond saving time, the sewing machine has reshaped how individuals engage with clothing and textiles - economically, creatively, and culturally. If you are interested in learning more about the Extension publications on hand and machine sewing, visit our Digital Collections to find out more.
