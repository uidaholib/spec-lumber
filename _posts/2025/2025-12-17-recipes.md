The holiday season brings opportunities to gather with loved ones and enjoy memorable meals together. However, selecting appropriate recipes for various occasions can be challenging. Special Collections and Archives offers an extensive collection of recipes suitable for any event. 

The University of Idaho has an long history with food and recipe development from the College of Agriculture's Home Economics and Extension programs.

When planning a holiday dinner, choosing which beverages to serve is an excellent starting point. Beyond traditional options such as sparkling beverages, water, or juice, consider Purple Cow - a delicious blend of milk and family-friendly flavors.

For many, dessert is arguably the best part of any meal. Cake and ice cream is a great dessert combination. Fruit ice creams, such as this recipe for Prune Ice Cream, easily complement cakes of all kinds. The DeLuxe Angel Cake, with a fluffy and light crumb, is an excellent choice to pair with prune ice cream.

Recipes in the archive aren't limited to Extension publications or at-home cooking. The University of Idaho has had an impactful influence on recipe development at the national level. Since the late 1800s, Senate Bean Soup has been a staple in the Capitol Hill cafeteria for US senators.

This soup was added as a permanent item on the menu thanks to Idaho Senator Fred Dubois. However, in 1950, one journalist noted his distaste for the soup and caused a nation-wide and state-wide uproar. This recipe was tested and perfected by UI Professor Adah Lewis and students in her cooking class before it replaced the old Dubois recipe. Read [Senate Bean Soup](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/posts/2024/03/07/soup.html) to find the recipe and to learn more about the University of Idaho's lasting influence on Capitol Hill!
