When it was built it was the largest white pine mill in the world. Due to the financial hardships of The Great Depression, in 1931, the Clearwater Timber Company merged with Potlatch Lumber Company and Rutledge Lumber Company becoming Potlatch Forests, Inc., today PotlatchDeltic. In these photographs, we see women working at the Clearwater Sawmill and Lumber factory sawing boards and loading cut boards from a conveyor belt, circa 1966. (MG 457)</p>
