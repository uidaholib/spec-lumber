<p>Yesterday, the 91st Annual Academy Awards announced their nominations. Today, we look at the 1946 Oscar-nominated screenplay <i>Anna and the King of Siam.</i></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="4032" data-orig-width="3024"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/182255800348_0.jpg" data-orig-height="4032" data-orig-width="3024"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="4032" data-orig-width="2708"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/182255800348_1.jpg" data-orig-height="4032" data-orig-width="2708"/></figure><p>Written by Sally Benson and University of Idaho graduate Talbot Jennings, the 1946 film <i>Anna and the King of Siam</i> was adapted from a 1944 novel of the same name, starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison.</p><p>

 The film received four total nominations, and won two Oscars, one for Best Cinematography, and the second for Best Art Direction. Sadly, Talbot Jennings and Sally Benson did not win the Oscar for Best Screenplay, but we’re sure it was an honor just to be nominated.
