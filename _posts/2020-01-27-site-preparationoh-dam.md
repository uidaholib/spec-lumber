Welcome back to another week of Oh Dam!, our series on dams in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>This week, we’re discussing how to prepare a site for dam construction. According to the British Dam Society, “a dam is built on a soil
or rock foundation, depending on the type of dam. The foundation must be strong
enough to carry the weight of the dam, and the water pressures acting on the
dam. The dam foundation is below the original ground level” and “is covered by
weaker soils or rock that have to be removed either by excavation or by
blasting with explosives.”[^1]

The photos below show explosions and construction workers
removing weathered and unsound surface rock in the bottom of the Columbia River
channel to provide for a watertight union of granite bedrock and whichever dam
they’re working on (it is unfortunately unidentified, but it is likely the
Grand Coulee Dam).

The fourth photo below shows bedrock in the old river channel and the
natural water-worn rock surface as it is found under a bed of clay and boulders
left in the canyon during the last ice age.
