<p>Happy Valentine’s Day! University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives celebrates this day by gently thumbing through an 1853 volume of Lord Byron’s <i>Poetic Works.</i>This volume includes a Byron poem which has been called one of the most romantic in the English language:</p><figure data-orig-width="1235" data-orig-height="1641" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/170863783070_0.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1235" data-orig-height="1641"/></figure><p>Researchers do not agree on Byron’s inspiration for the verse but it is thought it may have been his cousin who was mourning her husband’s death.<br/></p>
