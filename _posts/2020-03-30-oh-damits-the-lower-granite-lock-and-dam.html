<p>Welcome back to another week of Oh Dam!, our mini-series
on dams in the Pacific Northwest. Today, we’re discussing the Lower Granite Lock and Dam at
Snake River mile 107.5. The project was enabled by the River and Harbor Act of
1945. Construction began in 1965 and was completed in 1984. </p><p>The reservoir lake “created by the dam extends upstream
on the Snake River about 40 miles to Lewiston, Idaho, more than 460 river miles
from the Pacific Ocean.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>“In 2015, traffic through the navigation lock consisted
of grains, petroleum products, fertilizer, wood products, and miscellaneous
cargo that amounted to more than 1.1 trillion tons.”<a href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2142" data-orig-width="2662"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/614025586555437056_0.jpg" data-orig-height="2142" data-orig-width="2662"/></figure><p><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/blog/uispecialcollections/queue#_ftnref1" title="">[1-2]</a> <a href="https://www.nww.usace.army.mil/Locations/District-Locks-and-Dams/Lower-Granite-Lock-and-Dam/">https://www.nww.usace.army.mil/Locations/District-Locks-and-Dams/Lower-Granite-Lock-and-Dam/</a></p><p>Photos courtesy of PG 94, (<a href="https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv165618/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&amp;q=">Army Corps of Engineers Dam Construction Photographs, 1933-1965</a>), Special Collections and Archives, University of Idaho Library, Moscow, Idaho.
