Welcome back to another week of Oh Dam!, our mini-series
on dams in the Pacific Northwest. Today, we’re discussing the Grand Coulee Dam and irrigation
pumping plants and discharge pipes.

The Grand Coulee Dam is part of the larger Columbia Basin
Irrigation Project which was commissioned by Congress in 1943 (although
“construction of the irrigation system did not start until after World War
II”).[^1] The Project “is an immense irrigation development in central Washington state
that provides water from the Columbia River to about 671,000 acres on the
Columbia Plateau.”[^2]

Here’s how the system works: “water from Lake Roosevelt
behind Grand Coulee Dam is pumped uphill to a 27-mile-long reservoir, Banks
Lake, from which it flows by gravity into a series of canals. Outlets for
unused water empty into the Columbia above Richland and Pasco more than 125
miles to the south. The project includes more than 300 miles of main canals,
2,000 miles of laterals and 3,500 miles of drains and wasteways. The project
provides irrigation water to 2,050 farms. Apples, wheat and corn are the
largest-volume crops. There also are large herds of dairy cows and beef cattle.
Annually, the cash value of farm production in the Columbia Basin Project is
about $630 million.”[^2]

Additionally, “O’Sullivan Dam on Crab Creek about 15
miles south of Moses Lake creates Potholes Reservoir, which captures return
flows from the northern half of the project. The Potholes Canal flows out of
the lake and serves the southern part of the project.”[^2]
Said in another way, “Potholes Reservoir collects runoff from the north for
farms in the south. Water from drains and waste ways returns to the canal
system to be reused,” as “irrigation water from the Columbia Basin Project is
often used more than once before it returns to the Columbia River near Pasco
[Washington].”[^1]

“In addition to supplying water for irrigation, producing
electricity, controlling floods, providing recreation, and regulating
streamflow, the Columbia Basin Project also provides water for cities,
industries, navigation, and endangered species.”[^1]
