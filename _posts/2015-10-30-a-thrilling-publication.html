The first story, “Blood Across the Moor”, begins with: “Dr. Heckle’s plan needed only a human guinea pig for its trial before the gruesome device would be ready to use in his destruction of the world in which we live today.” The Blue Bucket was the university’s humor magazine that first published in 1923 and was produced six times each year by the Associated Students of the University of Idaho. Happy Halloween!</p>
