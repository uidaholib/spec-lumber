The first appearance of an all-girl band took place in 1943 at a send-off rally for the U of I men in the Enlisted Reserve Corps. Directed by Music Professor Edmund J. Marty, their goal was to amount to ‘99 Gals and a Guy.’ By 1945 an All-Girl Singing Orchestra was formed, becoming a hit on campus and billed to perform at cities and military installations across Idaho and the Northwest, including a two night performance at the Hanford Site in Washington. <br/></p><blockquote class="bg-light pt-1 px-4 font-italic"><p>PG 2_170-2, center section, all-girl band, 1943; PG_2-170-4, group photo with conductor, 1943; PG 2_260-1, group photo, all-girl orchestra and chorus, 1945; U of I Argonaut; <i>Beacon for Mountain and Plain </i></p></blockquote>
