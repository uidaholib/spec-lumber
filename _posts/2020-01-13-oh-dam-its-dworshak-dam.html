<p>Welcome back to another week of Oh Dam!, our mini-series on dams in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Today we’re discussing Dworshak Dam, the third tallest
dam in the United States and “the highest straight-axis concrete dam in the
Western Hemisphere.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>
It is located two miles upstream on the North Fork of the Clearwater River from
the town of Ahsahka, Idaho.</p><p>The project was instigated by the Flood Control Act of
1962. Construction began in 1966 and the dam “became operational for flood
damage reduction in June 1972. Power came online in March 1973.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[</a>2]</p><p>According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla
Walla District website, the Dworshak Dam has “prevented more than $2.8 million
in local potential flood damages” since 1972. In 2015, the dam “prevented about
$18 million in potential flood damages on the Columbia River.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[3]</a></p><figure data-orig-width="1948" data-orig-height="1920" class="tmblr-full"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/190236358190_0.jpg" data-orig-width="1948" data-orig-height="1920"/></figure><p>However, there are also drawbacks to the dam. “The
filling of the reservoir resulted in the loss of about 15,000 acres of
terrestrial habitat. The greatest loss of wildlife habitat was the winter range
for Rocky Mountain elk and white-tailed deer.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[4]</a>
Construction of the dam also resulted in large losses of anadromous steelhead
trout.</p><p>To address the loss of wildlife habitat, “mitigation
lands have been developed and are managed for winter range. About 7,000 acres
were purchased are managed specifically for elk mitigation.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[5]</a>
To address the loss of fish populations, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
constructed the Dworshak National Fish Hatchery, which is operated by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service. “The Dworshak hatchery is the largest steelhead
hatchery in the world. After Dworshak Reservoir was filled, kokanee salmon and
small mouth bass were stocked and became self-sustaining in the reservoir. The
abundance of kokanee salmon in the reservoir has made it a favored sport
species in the reservoir.”<a href="#_ftn2" title="">[6]</a></p><p>Clearly, there are pros and cons to large hydraulic dams like
Dworshak Dam in Idaho. Stay tuned for next week’s edition of Oh Dam! where we’ll
discuss preparing a site for dam construction!</p><figure data-orig-width="1576" data-orig-height="1245" class="tmblr-full"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/190236358190_1.jpg" data-orig-width="1576" data-orig-height="1245"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="1208" data-orig-height="1500" class="tmblr-full"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/190236358190_2.jpg" data-orig-width="1208" data-orig-height="1500"/></figure><p>
