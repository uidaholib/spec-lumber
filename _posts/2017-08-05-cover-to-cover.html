<p>Welcome to a new Special Collections and Archives Tumblr
series, <i>Cover to Cover, </i>where
occasional posts will highlight rare, interesting or unique books within our
collections. In honor of French author’s Guy de Maupassant’s birthday August 5<sup>th</sup>,
we feature an original color illustration from the frontispiece, or inside cover,
of Volume 11 of the seventeen volume set of his works published in 1903. This
gilt edged edition was the first set of his complete writings published in
English, a limited edition deluxe set, which was available only to subscribers.
The set in Special Collections was donated from the personal library of Jerome
J. Day, a prominent UI alumnus, Idaho businessman, state politician and University
regent.  <br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1721" data-orig-height="2849" class="tmblr-full mb-5"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/163830658694_0.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1721" data-orig-height="2849"/></figure>
