That’s a wrap on our series, Logging Lessons, featuring images and history from the Potlatch Lumber Company in North Idaho! At the beginning of this series, we discussed how early logging companies in Idaho felled trees - with a crosscut saw. Then, we discussed different methods of transporting logs from the forest floor to a central staging area - these methods included horses, jammers, and crawlers. Next, we discussed different methods of transporting logs from the central staging area to the lumber mill - these methods included water and trains. Finally, we discussed how to turn logs into usable lumber.

This painting of a sawmill, with its glowing wigwam burner, was inspired by the scene of workers leaving a small north Idaho mill at the end of their shift. Alf Dunn, University of Idaho Professor Emeritus of Art, created the watercolor. Bennett Lumber Products, Inc. has generously made the production of this card possible. The sale of this card is a fundraising project of the Latah County Historical Society and helps us preserve and interpret the heritage of Latah County!

In January, we start our next series on dams in the Pacific Northwest called Oh Dam! We hope you’ll join us! Happy holidays everyone!
