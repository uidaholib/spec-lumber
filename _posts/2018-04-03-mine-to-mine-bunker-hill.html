<p>In 1885, a prospectorâ€™s errant burro wandered off only to discover an outcropping of galena, a lead- and silver-rich ore. Within days, the Bunker Hill claim was established.<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="1164" data-orig-width="1346"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/172568713673_0.jpg" data-orig-height="1164" data-orig-width="1346"/></figure><p>
It grew from a strictly mining enterprise to a large industrial complex 
capable of carrying out every step in the production process from 
removing ore from the ground to fabricating finished metal products. The
 company became an important supplier of the nation&rsquo;s requirements for 
lead, zinc, silver, and cadmium. <br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full mb-5" data-orig-height="1227" data-orig-width="1485"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/library/spec/harvester/objects/tumblr/172568713673_1.jpg" data-orig-height="1227" data-orig-width="1485"/></figure><p style="">
Starting with the original Bunker Hill and Sullivan claims, the Bunker 
Hill Mine later encompassed 620 claims totaling 6,2000 acres. From the 
discovery cuts some 3600 feet above sea level, over 20 major ore zones 
were mined to nearly 1600 feet below sea level, a vertical distance of 
about one mile.

At its peak the company produced corroding lead, antimonial lead, 
silver, special high grade zinc, zinc diecasting alloys, cadmium, 
specification lead alloys, leaded zinc oxides, dore metal, super purity 
antimony, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid at its Kellogg, Idaho, 
operations, and manufactured lead products such as sheet, pipe, 
sleeving, casting, solders, shot, lead oxides and battery oxide, red 
lead, antimonial lead, and soft and calking lead, at its Seattle, 
Washington, operations. <br/></p><blockquote class="bg-light pt-1 px-4 font-italic"><p>From the top: PG 8_x24, Bunker Hill
