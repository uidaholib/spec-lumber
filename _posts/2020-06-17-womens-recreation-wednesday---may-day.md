Welcome back to another week of Women’s Recreation
Wednesday, our series covering the Women’s Recreation Association here at the
University of Idaho.

This week’s photos are from a May Day festival held in
1928 on campus.

May Day is an ancient Northern Hemisphere spring festival
celebrated on the first of May and dates back to origins in ancient Rome. The
festivities involve dancing, singing, and cake as people welcome the change in
season.[^1]

One very widely known dance of the holiday is the Maypole dance which might
originally have been part of a historic fertility ritual. A maypole would be
set up for the day and people would merrily dance around the pole clad with
colorful streamers and ribbons.[^1]

The personification of the May Day holiday and springtime is
the May Queen. She is a girl who wears a white gown to symbolize purity and is
crowned with flowers. She begins the May Day celebrations and makes a speech
before the dancing begins.[^1]

Stay tuned for next week’s installment of Women’s
Recreation Wednesday, where we’ll talk about Physical Education classes!
