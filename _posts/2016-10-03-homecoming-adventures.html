This Vandal, 

created by student editor Peter Paul Drus and whom we affectionately refer to as Baby Joe, first appeared in the 1924 Gem of the Mountains yearbook as well as a small statue. The original statue, which resides in Special Collections, is below. Big ‘Baby Joe’ also made an appearance in the Idaho Fan Zone to help us sell our newly published book <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/arcadia.html">“University of Idaho, the Campus History Series.”</a></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1992" data-orig-width="1121"><img src="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/media/spec/blog/151301743163_2.jpg" data-orig-height="1992" data-orig-width="1121"/></figure>
